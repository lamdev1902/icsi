<p>&nbsp;<strong>Engaging Health Care Consumers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With health care&nbsp;reform, there is an increased focus on the important role of consumer engagement in improving population health outcomes. Purchasers are focused on providing consumers with resources and tools that enhance clinical quality through the consideration of medical appropriateness to mitigate variations. Trends include the addition of services like Expert Remote Second Opinion and Treatment Decision Support. Behavioral economics approaches such as financial incentives tied to health coverage have been introduced to engage individuals in these programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This forum will highlight some of the most promising approaches in this increasingly important arena.</p>

36,"How Americans Perceive the Health Care System","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A nationally projectable poll of 1,011 American households conducted December 18-22, 1996, reveals a disturbing lack of confidence among the majority of Americans with the state and direction of health care and concern about health care quality, cost and coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The telephone poll, conducted by International Communications Research, was commissioned by The National Coalition on Health Care. The survey findings from a representative cross section of American households have a range of variation of no greater than plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their responses to a series of statements show that most people have little confidence in the ability of the system to care for people. The vast majority of Americans (79%) agree with the statement&nbsp;<em>""there is something seriously wrong with our health care system,""</em>&nbsp;87% agree that&nbsp;<em>""the quality of medical care for the average person needs to be improved,""</em>&nbsp;and only 15% have&nbsp;<em>""complete confidence""</em>&nbsp;in hospital care. Less than half of people (44%) say they have&nbsp;<em>""confidence in the health care system to take care of me.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eight in ten Americans believe that the quality of medical care is being compromised in the interest of profit. They feel that&nbsp;<em>""quality medical care has become unaffordable for the average American""</em>&nbsp;(79% agree), that&nbsp;<em>""hospitals have cut corners to save money""</em>&nbsp;(74% agree), that ""quality care is often compromised by health insurance companies to save money"" (80% agree), and that&nbsp;<em>""quality of medical care has gone down while costs have increased""</em>&nbsp;(64% agree). These views are held by people in fee-for-service plans as well as those in managed care plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a hunger to be better informed: 83% say they&nbsp;<em>""would like to be better informed about how to evaluate quality of medical care from doctors and hospitals,""</em>&nbsp;and 72%&nbsp;<em>""would like more information so [they] would feel more confident about decisions about medical care.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People are frightened by stories they've heard of medical care&nbsp;<em>""mistakes made that have hurt or even killed people""</em>&nbsp;(75%).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than half the respondents (57%) agree that&nbsp;<em>""hospital care is not very good""</em>&nbsp;and they risk being&nbsp;<em>""made sicker or more injured by mistakes made by poorly trained or overworked staff.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the majority feel confident that they could get quality medical care for themselves, they also believe there are serious problems with the quality of health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrary to the widely publicized view that government should stay out of health care, the vast majority of Americans feel that&nbsp;<em>""the federal government can play an important role in making health care better""</em>&nbsp;(69%) and ""more affordable"" (72%). These beliefs were shared by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The poll reveals a divided population regarding peace of mind and satisfaction of health care. About two-fifths of Americans are strongly alienated from the health care system. Many of those with annual household incomes of $25,000 or less are highly troubled by their experiences with cost, coverage and treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though they consider their current health care satisfactory, a large proportion of middle class respondents are also strongly troubled by what they see as serious flaws in the system related to quality, costs and access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four of every ten people polled have had reductions in coverage and are&nbsp;<em>""worried that they may lose their health insurance""</em>&nbsp;and feel they&nbsp;<em>""cannot afford medical insurance.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a positive note, four in every ten people ""strongly agree"" that their&nbsp;<em>""medical plan makes good health care affordable""</em>&nbsp;and over one-third (36%) ""strongly agree"" that they are&nbsp;<em>""satisfied with the quality of [their] health care.""</em>&nbsp;Over one-quarter (28%) ""strongly agree"" that they&nbsp;<em>""like the way their medical plan works""</em>&nbsp;and that&nbsp;<em>""[their] medical plan provides the best quality care they could want.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general, people over sixty-five years of age, and therefore covered by Medicare, are more satisfied with quality and coverage than are those in their thirties and forties. Not surprisingly, higher income families ($50,000 annual income) express more confidence and satisfaction with their health care than do those from households with middle or lower incomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four in ten Americans report having had a ""bad"" experience with treatment or care, don't have confidence in the system to take good care of them, or believe hospitals have cut corners to save money, thus endangering patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Focus group interviews recently completed in five cities prior to the survey amplify the findings of the polls. They reveal a depth of anger, fear and betrayal combined with a sense of frustration and pessimism for the future of health care. The prevailing view expressed in these interviews was that improvements in the health care system were being held hostage by partisan politics. Respondents in the focus groups displayed great cynicism about the motives and goals of the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The respondents showed impatience with the lack of progress in controlling costs, improving quality and access. Many of those who felt they were adequately protected by their insurance expressed concern and dismay at the plight of many people who they felt were unprotected and poorly cared for. Many had friends, neighbors and close relatives who lost their health insurance and were struggling to pay for or receive good health care. Their anxieties were underscored by the belief that even though they were currently protected, they could soon join the ranks without access to quality medical care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Detailed Findings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forty statements were read to survey respondents, one at a time, and after reading each statement to the respondents the interviewer asked whether they agreed or disagreed with what was said. Next the respondents were asked whether they agreed or disagreed ""strongly"" or ""somewhat."" In this way the survey was able to measure a comprehensive set of perceptions and beliefs about health care and determine how strongly held these perceptions and beliefs were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A. Perceptions of Quality</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen statements dealt directly with perceptions of quality of health care.&nbsp;<strong>The responses to many of these statements reveal very high levels of dissatisfaction with and concern about health care quality.</strong>&nbsp;The statement that generated the most agreement was&nbsp;<em>""the quality of medical care for the average person needs to be improved.""</em>&nbsp;59% of the survey participants agreed ""strongly"" with this view and an additional 28% agreed ""somewhat.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Health care was broadly criticized by eight in every ten respondents who agreed with the statement&nbsp;<em>""there is something seriously wrong with our health care system.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A more direct indictment of the quality of care was made by 75% who agreed that ""there are serious problems with the quality of health care.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Many Americans perceive the drive for profits is taking precedence over concern for quality or people.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Half of the survey participants disagreed with the statement that&nbsp;<em>""quality treatment is the most important thing to health insurance companies,""</em>&nbsp;while 29% agreed ""strongly"" with this statement. Eighty percent of Americans agree that&nbsp;<em>""quality care is often compromised by insurance companies to save money.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Disturbing stories about the quality of care have taken their toll on the confidence people have in the system.</strong>&nbsp;Three quarters of people agreed with the statement&nbsp;<em>""I've heard some disturbing stories about medical care and mistakes that hurt or even killed people.""</em>&nbsp;Four in ten Americans report they have had a bad experience with medical treatment or care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Hospitals came under severe criticism.</strong>&nbsp;Three quarters of people agreed that&nbsp;<em>""cuts in service endanger patients.""</em>&nbsp;Only 15% would agree ""strongly"" that they had&nbsp;<em>""complete confidence in hospital care.""</em>&nbsp;To the statement that&nbsp;<em>""hospital care is not very good-- you're likely to get sicker or more injured by mistakes made by poorly trained and overworked staff,""</em>&nbsp;24% agreed ""strongly"" and 24% agreed ""somewhat."" Only 19% were in ""strong disagreement"" with this statement.<strong>Table 1</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B. Perceptions of Cost</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine statements concerned the cost of medical care, health insurance and the relationship between cost and quality. It should be noted that to most people the term ""health insurance companies"" is virtually synonymous with managed care as well as traditional indemnity plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>People perceive costs rising, coverage decreasing and quality going down at the same time. This equation adds up to anger, fear and cynicism.</strong>&nbsp;Nearly six in every ten people ""strongly"" agreed that&nbsp;<em>""quality health care is almost unaffordable for the average person""</em>&nbsp;and an additional 22% ""somewhat"" agreed. To the statement&nbsp;<em>""health insurance premiums have gone up and coverage has gone down,""</em>&nbsp;44% ""strongly"" agreed and 27% ""somewhat"" agreed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The cynicism of people is evident in their responses. They feel they are paying more and getting less while providers are profiting.</strong>&nbsp;This view is reflected in the agreement with the statement that the&nbsp;<em>""high cost of medical care is due in part to greed of the insurance companies""</em>&nbsp;(43% ""strongly"" agree, 26% ""somewhat"" agree). Only 10% agreed strongly that&nbsp;<em>""health insurance companies put the needs of customers ahead of profits""</em>&nbsp;while 43% ""strongly"" disagreed with this favorable view of their insurers. Nearly two-thirds of people agree (36% ""strongly"") that&nbsp;<em>""medical care costs have gone up but quality of care has gone down.""</em><strong>Table 2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The population is divided on the impact of cost.</strong>&nbsp;Four out of every ten people&nbsp;<em>""worry that they will not be able to afford quality medical care for a serious illness""</em>&nbsp;(39% ""strongly"" agree and 19% ""somewhat"" agree) and feel that&nbsp;<em>""the costs of health insurance have put a serious dent in our budget""</em>&nbsp;(40% ""strongly"" agree and 19% ""somewhat"" agree). An equal proportion of people say that&nbsp;<em>""my medical plan makes good health care affordable""</em>&nbsp;(38% ""strongly"" agree, 33% ""somewhat"" agree). Over one quarter of respondents feel that they cannot afford medical insurance (28% ""strongly"" agree and 12% ""somewhat"" agree).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Contrary to much of the rhetoric surrounding the debate on health care reform, most people believe the federal government can play an important role in making health care better and more affordable</strong>&nbsp;(50% strongly agreed, 22% somewhat agree).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C. Trust and Confidence</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The survey responses reflect a lack of trust and confidence in the health care system. A system which people depend on seems to have turned into a big profit-generating business that cares little for the needs and feelings of the individual. A woman from California who participated in a recent focus group summed up this feeling by saying&nbsp;<em>""there's not much care left in health care these days.""</em></strong><strong>Table 3</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Nearly one-third of Americans are troubled by what they see as a health care system that will not take care of them. They have little confidence in the future.</strong>&nbsp;<em>""I'm not very optimistic about the future of health care""</em>&nbsp;found 32% in ""strong"" agreement and an additional 26% ""somewhat"" in agreement. An industry that&nbsp;<em>""puts profits ahead of people""</em>&nbsp;was seen by 52% (""strongly"" agree). Only 10% of respondents agreed strongly that&nbsp;<em>""health insurance companies put the needs of their customers ahead of profits""</em>&nbsp;while 43% disagreed strongly with this statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When asked whether they can&nbsp;<em>""trust their health insurance company to do the right thing for me,""</em>&nbsp;20% agreed strongly while 33% were of the opposite opinion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A desire to be better informed is driven in part by a lack of trust.</strong>&nbsp;Over half the respondents (55%) agreed strongly that they&nbsp;<em>""would like to be better informed about how to evaluate quality of medical care from doctors and hospitals.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D. Coverage</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The population is divided between those who feel they have good health care coverage and are not worried about losing it and those who feel unprotected and vulnerable to losing their insurance.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About one-quarter of the respondents strongly agreed that they worried about losing their coverage. A similar proportion agreed that their coverage&nbsp;<em>""keeps changing and getting less.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three out of every ten survey respondents strongly agreed that they were&nbsp;<em>""not worried about their health insurance,""</em>&nbsp;and that they&nbsp;<em>""liked the way their medical insurance works.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While over one-third of people feel that their coverage is satisfactory they are troubled by what they see as an erosion of quality and inequities in care, access and coverage for the population at large.<strong>Table 4</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E. Perceived Role of Government</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Contrary to much of the rhetoric that surrounded the health care reform debate, the public sees an important role for government. Most people feel that the federal government, state and local government, and Congress can help make health care more affordable and raise the standards of quality.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When asked if&nbsp;<em>""the federal government can play an important role in making health care more affordable,""</em>&nbsp;50% agreed strongly and 22% agreed somewhat. When the role for federal government was described as&nbsp;<em>""making health care better,""</em>&nbsp;43% agreed strongly. In answer to the question&nbsp;<em>""government should stay out of health care altogether,""</em>&nbsp;28% were in ""strong"" agreement, 12% ""somewhat"", and 29% were in ""strong"" disagreement.<strong>Table 5</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When given a list of possible roles for federal government in health care, assuming government would be involved in some way, the vast majority of people said ""yes"" to setting quality standards (86%), making sure everyone has access to quality medical care regardless of their ability to pay (84%), and stepping in when organizations do not meet standards (84%).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerns raised by those polled were system-wide, relating to quality of care delivered, cost of health care and accessibility of care for the average American. While those surveyed had confidence in their personal health care delivery, there was a notable lack of confidence in the health care system at large. These anxieties crossed gender, political, age, economic and regional boundaries. Additionally, there is a widely held perception that the future of health care does not look goodóthere is little confidence that the quality of health care delivery can be improved or that health care will be available to the average American.

<p>The U.S. is alone among developed nations in failing to assure more affordable medications for its citizens. Medicare trustees have an obligation to act prudently to obtain fair prices for beneficiaries. Recent research has shown 80% of FDA-approved pharmaceutical patents go to small changes in medications already on the market, rather than to truly innovative new cures. Large pharma companies spend much more on stock buybacks and direct-to-consumer marketing than they do on R&amp;D for truly innovative cures. For example,&nbsp;<a href=""https://quotes.wsj.com/PFE"">Pfizer</a>&nbsp;spent $139 billion on buybacks and dividends compared with $82 billion on R&amp;D over the past decade. We need to rebalance the pharmaceutical market to achieve fairer, more affordable prices along with continued incentives for research on the most important health-care needs.</p>

<p><strong>With Supreme Court Ruling, Big Decisions Ahead for Congress</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This morning, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, but the really big decision on health care won’t come until late this year in Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most controversial provision of the law, known as the individual mandate, was affirmed by the court as a valid exercise of Congress’s power to tax. The decision ensures that implementation of state health insurance exchanges can go forward and that millions more Americans will have access to health insurance in 2014.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As important as this decision is, the $7.3 trillion fiscal cliff looming at the end of the year could have even greater impact. With the sequester and Sustainable Growth Rate provider rate cuts scheduled for January, and continually growing health spending that puts pressure on governments, businesses and families, Congress will have to act on health care. The question is how.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some would have the strapped federal government shift more of its costs onto state governments, consumers or providers. This approach might give the appearance of fiscal responsibility, but it allows hundreds of billions in waste to remain in the health system. Simply shuffling costs from one budget to another does not help to put our fiscal house in order in the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is another way. It boils down to a simple principle: spending our health care dollars wisely. That means taking a look at the third of every health care dollar that isn’t improving anyone’s health. It means transforming today’s sick care system into a health care system that can fight the rising prevalence and cost of chronic disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this approach to succeed, however, consumers, providers and policymakers each have a part to play. More consumers will have to take responsibility for managing their own health and choosing high-quality, low-cost providers and care. Providers will have to move beyond fee-for-service payments and transition to new, coordinated models of care that deliver better care at lower costs. Policymakers will have to craft viable policy solutions that enhance competition in health care markets, curb waste and fraud in public programs and adjust a range of agriculture, education, taxation and medical liability policies that impact our health costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all the partisan debate over the Affordable Care Act, leaders in both political parties recognize that the current rate of growth in health spending is unsustainable. Now that the Court has settled the legal dispute, it is time for Republicans and Democrats alike to come together around common ground strategies that attack waste and ensure all of us are getting the most from our health care dollar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The court battle over the Affordable Care Act may be over,” said President and CEO John Rother, “but when it comes to curbing health costs, the real work has only just begun.”</p>

<p>This morning, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act,&nbsp; but the really big decision on health care won’t come until late this year in Congress.

54,"Will health care cops come after you for not buying mandated health insurance?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allie Johnson</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The requirement in the new&nbsp;federal health care reform law&nbsp;that almost every individual must buy health insurance raises one big question: Exactly how will it work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some pundits have fueled concerns that this provision, known as the individual mandate, will have health care cops knocking on doors and government spies peeking at insurance policies. But experts say that in the worst-case scenario, you’d likely just get a letter from the IRS and be hit with a fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s requirements for individuals – and how they’ll be enforced:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How the individual mandate works</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting in 2014, almost every individual will have to buy&nbsp;health insurance&nbsp;that meets certain minimum standards set by the federal government. However, there are loopholes. Some individuals will be able to skip health insurance without being fined, such as members of Indian tribes, prisoners, and people with religious objections who ask for and get an exemption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some people will be excused for financial reasons, including those who would end up paying more than 8 percent of their income in premiums and those who make so little money that they don’t have to file income tax returns – right now, that’s $9,500 a year for an individual or $19,000 for a couple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most people, though, the first step will be to look at whether you get affordable coverage that meets federal standards through your job, says Jeffrey Ingalls, president of The Stratford Financial Group, an insurance consulting and brokerage firm, and author of “Healthcare Reform Made Easy,” a guide geared toward employers and employees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individuals who don’t get qualifying coverage through their jobs or their spouses’ jobs will need to buy coverage through their state health insurance exchange, a health insurance marketplace that will offer four levels of plans, according to John Rother, president and CEO of the nonprofit National Coalition on Health Care. For many consumers, tax credits will help offset the cost of insurance. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a hypothetical person making about $28,000 a year might get a tax credit of just under $3,500 and end up paying a little more than $2,300 a year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how will the government check up on you to see whether you’ve bought health insurance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, health insurance companies will report policy purchases to the federal government. Second, the IRS will include a space on your income tax return where you provide proof of insurance, such as a company name and policy number, according to Ingalls. Along with your tax return, you probably will have to submit a document from your insurance company that summarizes your coverage, he says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What happens to health insurance outlaws?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you decide not to buy health insurance, you’ll have to pay a fine. Here’s how it works:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For the first year, 2014, you’ll pay either 1 percent of your household income or $95 for each adult, whichever is greater.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In 2015, the fine will go up to 2 percent of your household income or $325 for each adult, whichever is greater.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In 2016, the fine will reach 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult. After that, the amount will be adjusted based on cost-of-living increases.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For each uninsured child under 18, parents get penalized at half the adult amount.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The total fine is capped at $285 for a family the first year, $975 the second year and at $2,085 in following years.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you owe a fine, you’ll pay the IRS in the same way you would for a balance due on your income tax. If you don’t pay the fine, though, the IRS won’t be allowed to use some of the tougher tools – such as garnishing wages or seizing property – that it can use to crack down on people who don’t pay their taxes. Instead, experts say, you might get a letter and a bill from the IRS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some experts say the low fines and weak enforcement won’t compel many consumers to obey the law. “I don’t think anybody will buy coverage to avoid this fine,” Ingalls says. He points out, for example, that a person making $25,000 a year might pay a $250 fine the first year, while a&nbsp;cheap health insurance plan&nbsp;probably would cost more than that each month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, people who don’t want to shell out money for any type of insurance always have found ways to evade the law, Rother says. People can buy coverage for a month, then cancel or refuse to pay the next month’s premium, says Rother, noting that some drivers already do that to defy state auto insurance requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no one can say for sure right now how enforcement of the new law will unfold, Rother says. It will take at least two years to assess the effects of the law and see how many people actually buy health insurance, he says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any new law, especially one as complicated as the Affordable Care Act, is going to take a while to get all the kinks straightened out,” Rother says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
62,"POLITICO: Why Trump still needs Obamacare","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Texas judge’s stunning declaration that Obamacare is unconstitutional not only kneecaps the health care law, it would also cripple President Donald Trump’s entire health care agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump wants lower drug prices, drastic action on the opioid crisis and protection for people with pre-existing conditions. Those are the parts of the law many Republicans do want to keep, but with the entire law invalidated — pending appeal — Trump and Republicans are trying to figure out how to live with a judicial ruling they kind of wanted, but didn’t want in such a big way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The blunt force of the Texas ruling, without consideration for the dozens of popular provisions sprinkled throughout the law, shows just how intertwined the Affordable Care Act has become as part of the American health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And nobody on the Republican side has a clear plan on what to do now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing is changing yet. But if the ruling does stand following appeals, or if the Trump administration reverses course and refuses to enforce more parts of the law, because of the Texas case, seniors would immediately be on the hook for thousands of dollars in additional drug spending. Millions of Americans would lose Medicaid coverage — the largest payer of addiction treatment in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the administration would also lose access to a powerful weapon for reforming the U.S. health system — the CMS Innovation Center. Created by the health law, it gives the government broad powers to test new health policies, whether it be doctor payment models or new cancer drug pricing ideas, and scale them up nationally without congressional approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump cheered the Friday federal court ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. “Great news for America!”&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1073763695807877120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1073763695807877120&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2018%2F12%2F15%2F18142063%2Fobamacare-unconstitutional-trump-great-health-care-law"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">he tweeted</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But without Obama’s signature law, the Trump administration would be left scrambling to achieve its health care goals, while simultaneously dealing with a system thrust into chaos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump’s health department has identified&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/priorities/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">four main priorities</a>: lowering the cost of prescription drugs, ending the opioid crisis, improving health insurance’s availability and affordability, and moving the health system to one that pays for the quality of services offered, not the quantity. And even as the Trump administration bashes the ACA, it’s leaning hard on it to accomplish these goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The court’s decision “is a cloud over the efforts to keep moving forward on health reforms and it’s going to create confusion and probably delay,” said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, adding, “Now I wonder how we’re going to be able to keep up the momentum” on issues such as drug pricing and payment reform.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The breadth of the act is extraordinarily sweeping, and it will affect every aspect of the health system if it’s struck down, including many things this administration has publicly championed or made priorities,” said Rachel Sachs, a health policy expert and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without Obamacare, Americans would see drug spending go up with seniors and state governments taking the brunt of the blow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the exact opposite of Trump’s extensive blueprint on lowering drug prices. The goal, the president&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-lowering-drug-prices/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">said in May</a>, is to take “the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without Obamacare, many seniors would likely spend around $2,000 or more in out-of-pocket drug costs each year, said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s because the ACA required drugmakers to provide big discounts to seniors in the coverage gap phase of their Medicare Part D benefit. In 2016, more than 5 million Medicare recipients reached the coverage gap, with drugmakers providing $5.7 billion in discounts to offset the costs of their medicines, Cubanski said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>States’ Medicaid programs, which are a big part of state budgets, would also take a hit because drug companies could go back to giving them the smaller pre-Obamacare discounts on medications, and these discounts wouldn’t apply to Medicaid managed care programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the biosimilar market, which Trump’s FDA chief, Scott Gottlieb, has spent months trying to invigorate and improve, would collapse as Obamacare established the pathway to bring cheaper versions of biologic medicines to patients. Those drugs are often the most expensive medicines in the U.S.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As if it’s not challenging enough already for biosimilars to get approved and actually come to market in this country, this would make it even more challenging,” Cubanski said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, Trump’s HHS would have a much more difficult time implementing its new ideas to lower the cost of medicines, like an&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/25/trump-medicare-drug-prices-plan-888607"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">October plan</a>&nbsp;to tie the cost of physician-administered drugs — things like chemotherapy or other infused medications — in Medicare to the lower prices paid by other developed countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without Obamacare’s Innovation Center, Trump would likely need congressional approval to implement such a sweeping national test on drug prices — a long shot given recent skepticism from his own party, the drug industry, and patient and doctor groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Innovation Center is also a key component of the Trump administration’s plan to move the health system away from paying for the sheer number of services provided, and instead incentivize good care — and it could unveil new projects as soon as the first three months of 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HHS Secretary Alex Azar teased their release,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?455835-1/secretary-azar-axios-health-care-forum&amp;start=387"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">saying on Wednesday</a>&nbsp;that “the biggest things that we’re going to be launching, coming soon, are going to be these demonstrations that Adam Boehler — our head of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation — has been working on.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s a lot of basic payment plumbing in the ACA. Ripping it out would be enormously disruptive,” Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, wrote in an email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doctors and hospitals are still committed to the payment reform effort, several sources told POLITICO, as they’ve already devoted ample time, money and resources into moving toward value-based care. CMMI projects have been underway for years, so eliminating the center would, as Bagley put it, still be an “enormous procedural headache.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a possibility that a higher court could keep parts of the health law, such as CMMI, but rule otherparts of Obamacare invalid, like the popular protections for pre-existing conditions. While the Trump administration has committed to ensuring those people would still have health coverage, it hasn’t offered any suggestions on how to preserve those protections in a concrete waywithout Obamacare — which Democrats capitalized on during the midterm elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the opioid front,Trump has repeatedly promised to end the scourge of addiction. But experts say any rollback in Medicaid coverage, the biggest payer of behavioral health care, would almost certainly set back his efforts to address the crisis killing 115 Americans every day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The administration and Congress have invested billions to expand access to treatment, but work funded by those grants would likely be dwarfed by coverage losses if Medicaid expansion goes away under Friday’s ruling. Roughly&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/Key%20state%20SMI-OUD%20v3corrected.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">1.2. million people</a>&nbsp;with addiction and mental health issues are covered under Medicaid expansion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicaid is the “bedrock” of addiction treatment, said Andrew Kessler, founder of Slingshot Solutions, a consulting firm specializing in behavioral health. “You can’t do a single thing to inhibit Medicaid If you say you want to see improvement in substance use disorder treatment. The two don’t go together.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advocates say scrapping the law would also be harmful to the tens of thousands of people in the private insurance market seeking help for drug addiction, since Obamacare requires insurers to cover treatment as part of 10 essential health benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any backtracking on this would be a significant blow to patients,” said Mark Covall, president and CEO of the National Association for Behavioral Healthcare.</p>

65,"What I Learned at the Brookings Institution","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John Rother</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Gilead President:&nbsp; We Price Based on How Others Priced Before</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>HCV Expert:&nbsp; Perhaps as many as 10 million infected with HCV</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I attended a panel discussion at the Brookings Institution today entitled, “The Cost and Value of Biomedical Innovation: Implications for Health Policy.” There were a number of interesting issues discussed at the panel, including how we do a better job of paying for value in health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Price Based on Previous Prices</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the panelists was Dr. John Milligan, the President of Gilead. In his remarks Dr. Milligan discussed how Gilead priced Sovaldi and, just as importantly, how they plan to price future all-oral iterations. Dr. Milligan indicated that while they were aware of a variety of factors, it was ultimately the prices of previous therapies that determined their approach to price. He acknowledged that while they believe Sovaldi has a return on investment (ROI), Gilead did not attempt to factor ROI into any consideration of the price–it was simply looking at the previous, less desirable therapy and going up from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps even more concerning he indicated that their approach to future pricing for their all-oral therapy would be the same:&nbsp;looking at the price of current therapies and then basing their price off of those. Current combination therapy for HCV can range from $100,000 to $150,000 per patient. This approach to pricing is indeed disturbing news because it creates an upward spiral of prices. As many panelists pointed out, we need more independent measures to deal with how companies price when they have monopolistic pricing power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>10 million infected?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Douglas Dietrich, MD also presented on the panel and noted that in his experience testing for HCV in urban settings, the incidence was roughly 8% and that by his rough calculations we may be looking at a total patient population of as many as 10 million Americans infected with HCV. If that’s even close to accurate it blows the doors off all current cost projections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Big Picture</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there was a lot of discussion about Sovaldi at the event, only a couple of panelists touched on the bigger issue: the huge number of high-cost specialty medicines in the pipeline and the fact that many of them are chronic medications. For all the talk about cures, the reality is that most high-priced medicines are not cures. Some panelists talked about taking out “mortgages” for high-priced medicines, but unlike a house (where you only need one) the reality of medicines is that a single patient might need several over a lifetime. Simply spreading out the cost is not a workable solution to the issue of increasing costs any more than letting Americans borrow more than they could afford for homes was a good idea. That policy drove up the price of housing and eventually led to economic disaster. Let’s learn from our mistakes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
69,"We Don’t Want to Say “I Told You So,” But….","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD) recently issued a letter to Congress that included a variety of interesting proposals but also raised the specter of direct or indirect price controls for the very high-priced Hepatitis drugs that are devastating state Medicaid budgets. While NAMD explicitly did not endorse any single proposal, its appeal to Congress highlights the frustration felt by many stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our coalition has repeatedly warned that the debate is likely to move toward some form of price control unless Gilead and its brethren start to act more responsibly and sincerely engage with health care stakeholders. Thus far Gilead’s response has been the opposite – it has dug in its heels and been quite clear that its most important stakeholder is Wall Street. We have repeatedly stated that we do not support price controls because we believe there are better options to address extremely high prices. Perhaps the most important change we need to institute is a more robust and data-driven discussion about the value proposition of new high-priced medicines BEFORE they are introduced. Medicines can absolutely deliver important value to patients and to the health care system. Unfortunately, there is often little dialogue about value proposition prior to pricing, particularly for medicines that face little competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NAMD points that the mere presence of other drugs on the market doesn’t always offer the hope of reasonable pricing:: “Though there is potential for more state negotiating power as new drugs enter the market, we cannot speculate on how effective these negotiations will be in light of the possibility that these drugs will be priced similarly to Sovaldi.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State Medicaid Directors are quite literally on the front lines of health care, serving the most vulnerable among us. Their only motive is to sustainably deliver health care to those in need. While our coalition’s policy prescriptions may differ from those of State Medicaid directors, we commend the directors for their leadership in continuing to put a spotlight on the challenges to our health care system posed by the unsustainable pricing of certain medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The debate need not go in the direction of price controls. There are opportunities for stakeholders to come together and find innovative solutions, and our coalition stands ready to work with pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders to find approaches that protect the innovation we all want now and into the future.</p>

71,"Update on Most Favored Nation Rule Litigation","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On November 27, 2020, CMS published the Most Favored Nation (MFN) Interim Final Rule (IFR) seeking to lower the amount of money paid for 50 high-cost Medicare Part B drugs to the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other developed countries. Almost immediately, interested parties across the country filed lawsuits seeking to stop the rule from taking effect. We will discuss the MFN rule and the procedures CMS took to promulgate it, three of the most prominent lawsuits regarding this rule, as well as discuss the impact the Biden Administration can have on the future of this rule. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Most Favored Nation Rule</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rule would establish a new, mandatory reimbursement model for Medicare Part B drugs (i.e., drugs administered in a doctor’s office such as chemotherapy). The question the MFN Model is trying to answer is whether closely aligning payment for Medicare part B drugs with international prices and removing incentives to use higher-cost drugs can control the growth in Medicare Part B spending without adversely affecting quality of care for beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MFN price is based on the lowest GDP-adjusted price paid by an OECD member country with a GDP per capita that is at least 60 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. The MFN price will be phased in over four years of the total seven-year model, phasing in 25% per year for the first four years. CMS will also not allow for the model payment amount for a drug to exceed the current Average Sales Price (ASP). Additionally, the current add-on payment to providers for Part B drugs (6 percent of ASP) will be replaced with a flat payment per dose that is uniform for all included drugs in the MFN Model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MFN Model affects 50 Medicare Part B drugs that encompass a high percentage of Medicare Part B drug spending. CMS developed this list of 50 Part B drugs based on annual Medicare Part B spending in 2019, excluding certain claims and types of drugs. CMS will assess this list of 50 drugs each year and update the list based on annual Medicare Part B spending, after applying certain exclusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Litigation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since CMS announced the MFN Model IFR, multiple parties filed lawsuits in federal court. Most notably, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), Regeneron, and the Community Oncology Alliance (among other plaintiffs) each filed a lawsuit challenging the MFN rule. Each plaintiff filed suit along similar lines, including violations of the&nbsp;<em>Administrative Procedure Act (APA)</em>&nbsp;that requires public comment periods for most rulemaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal courts in Maryland, California, and New York have weighed in on the PhRMA case, BIO case, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals case, respectively. In New York, the District Court preliminarily enjoined CMS from applying the MFN Rule to Regeneron’s drug EYLEA; whereas, the District Court in California preliminarily enjoined CMS from implementing the MFN Rule altogether.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The District Court order in California vacated the MFN Rule until CMS completes the notice-and-comment rulemaking process proscribed under the APA. Notably, the court order does not require CMS to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking, rather the court requires CMS to undergo notice-and-comment rule making only if CMS intends to promulgate the MFN Rule. In New York Federal District Court, a Judge ruled in a similar fashion for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, granting Regeneron’s preliminary injunction, however, the scope of this preliminary injunction is much narrower. In fact, the court order only applies to Regeneron’s drug, EYLEA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 13, the District Court in Maryland granted a stay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering the various lawsuits levied against CMS for promulgating the MFN Rule without initiating notice-and-comment rulemaking, CMS agreed to (1) not appeal the court decision in California nor the decision in New York and (2) they will not promulgate the MFN Rule without first publishing in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of the courts have touched the constitutional claims or statutory interpretation claims levied by the plaintiffs. Instead, each court only ruled on the APA procedural claims, finding each time that CMS failed to properly promulgate the IFR because they could not show the good cause required to bypass notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What Could the Biden Administration Do Next?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Biden Administration could choose to go forward with the notice-and-comment rule making process and promulgate the MFN Model Rule as is. Alternatively, the Biden Administration can go back to the drawing board re-issue a new MFN proposal and proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Or, they can scrap the rule altogether. It is increasingly unlikely that the Biden Administration will choose to defend and re-issue the rule with a comment period. President Biden released a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/"">regulatory freeze</a>&nbsp;on January 20 that would immediately rescind any unpublished or proposed rulemaking or pause any rules that have not taken effect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is “<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/01/02/court-injunction-temporarily-upends-most-favored-nation-policy-to-lower-prices-of-medicare-part-b-drugs/?sh=2bdf5660505b"">quite conceivable</a>” that Biden would pressure Congress to pass drug pricing legislation to lower drug prices in a similar fashion as the MFN Model. For example, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3) supported by House democrats includes a very similar price control mechanism – Medicare negotiations for a selection of high-cost Part B and Part D drugs would be pegged to international prices (in addition to a variety of other provisions). The current lawsuits would not have any obvious implications for an act of Congress, especially because the courts ruled primarily on procedural matters of rulemaking.&nbsp;</p>

72,"MAY 1998 <strong>SURGEON GENERAL SAYS ""HIDDEN EPIDEMIC"" OF POOR QUALITY CARE MUST BE ADDRESSED</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>U.S. Surgeon General&nbsp;<strong>David Satcher</strong>, M.D., told Coalition members in May heíll follow in his predecessorsí footsteps and use his office as a bully pulpit to promote healthy lifestyles and regular physical exercise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Satcher says he also hopes to get the federal health bureaucracy in Washington to focus on problems it has too long ignored. Chief among them is the ""hidden epidemic"" related to health care quality. Satcher praised the Coalitionís efforts to bring this problem to the fore. ""Despite a growing sophistication in technology and medical science, there continue to be real gaps in the quality of care available to many Americans,"" he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In particular, Satcher wants to raise Americansí awareness of the disparities in the health status of blacks versus whites. He said black Americans are in overall poorer health than whites, have less access to care and poorer outcomes even when they do get care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fight to rectify that situation, Satcher said, involves expanding insurance coverage for low-income people overall but also strengthening the nationís public health infrastructure. He said it was no longer acceptable that the government spends only 1% of its health care budget on population-based prevention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Medicine and public health must become one,íí Satcher asserted. He said he was personally involved in an effort to create a more open dialogue between the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association, two professional groups that have often been at ideological odds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Satcher, who took office February 13, listed among his other priorities: assuring that kids get a healthy start in life and bringing mental health care into the nationís public health agenda. As an example of the latter, Satcher said the rising rate of teen suicide demands a public health response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We have environments of hopelessness in many parts of our country,"" he said. ""We must counter that with programs that offer hope. We have to make troubled teens part of the solution, not just point the finger at them.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pollster and Republican strategist&nbsp;<strong>Bill McInturff</strong>, a partner in Public Opinion Strategies, echoed Satcherís message. He said the erosion of public confidence in health care ñ and in managed care in particular ñ is deepening, with a third of the population now calling for ""radical change"" in the system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said Democratic candidates in this yearís elections will likely ""cast Republicans as the pro-HMO party"" if they (the Republicans) block patient protection legislation this summer or fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Colorado Governor&nbsp;<strong>Richard Lamm</strong>, now a professor at the University of Denver, told Coalition members that the nation should not move to cover all uninsured persons until it grapples with the controversial issue of setting necessary limits on the delivery and cost of medical care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We simply can not do it all,"" Lamm said. ""We must set priorities."" Lamm maintains that medicine has been too broadly defined to include such services as long term care and more recently alternative medicine. Paying for such services for the aging baby boomers, he said, would ""break the bank"" and not be an efficient use of health care dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>STUDY FINDS COMMON THEMES IN HEALTH SURVEYS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The American public has become increasingly concerned about our countryís health care system. People are worried about losing insurance coverage, paying for care if they lack coverage, and the quality of their care, even if they are insured. These concerns exist independent of the types of plans in which people are enrolled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are among the conclusions from a new analysis of 22 public opinion surveys on health care conducted between</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>December 1996 and December 1997. Taken together, the surveys represent the sentiments of almost 35,000 American consumers. The analysis, conducted by&nbsp;<strong>Joel Miller</strong>, policy director at the Coalition, is the first to probe for common themes among disparate, recent surveys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast to the past when concern was predominantly found among the poorer and uninsured populations, today those concerns also exist among middle-class, working Americans and especially those who have had recent contact with our health care system, the analysis found. In fact, the majority of Americans think the health care system is seriously flawed, and their confidence and trust in that system is eroding. The analysis reveals a disconnect</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>between the publicís concern and declining public confidence in the health care system and the solutions being proposed by lawmakers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""At a time when most Americans are optimistic about the economy and their future, they are pessimistic about their ability to continue to obtain and afford high quality health care, especially if they become seriously ill,"" said&nbsp;<strong>Henry E. Simmons, M.D</strong>., President of the Coalition. ""This concern is grounded in their personal experiences or those of a relative or friend. In fact, four in ten Americans reported personally having had a ëbad experienceí with medical care,"" he added.</p>

<p>COALITION BRIEFS BUSINESS LEADERS IN DENVER, DES MOINES</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than forty CEOís of major national corporations and local businesses attended Executive Briefings on Health Care conducted by the Coalition in Denver and Des Moines this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition developed the Executive Briefing Series in response to feedback from previous conferences. The sessions were structured to focus beyond the immediate cost issues surrounding the provision of health care benefits to include a broader understanding of the meaningful role that business has in determining the nationís future health care environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Denver Meeting</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalitionís Denver meeting was co-sponsored by the Kauvar Foundation and the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver. Attendees included CEOís, Chairmen, Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who gathered at the University of Denverís Phipps Mansion for a four-hour session on March 31<sup>st</sup>. The meeting began with welcoming remarks by&nbsp;<strong>James D. Griesemer, Ph.D.,&nbsp;</strong>Dean of the Daniels College of Business, and&nbsp;<strong>Abe Kauvar, M.D.,</strong>&nbsp;Founder and President of the Kauvar Foundation. The session was facilitated by&nbsp;<strong>Michael Maccoby</strong>, President, Maccoby Consulting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The participants voiced concern about rising health care costs, a lack of public understanding of health care as a ""system,"" a need for universal insurance coverage and a common definition of health care quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dr. Henry Simmons</strong>, the Coalitionís President, provided the group with an overview of the current state of the health care system. During the luncheon,&nbsp;<strong>Kenneth Thorpe, Ph.D.,</strong>&nbsp;of Tulane University explained the rising costs of health care and the implications for business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Des Moines Meeting</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting in Des Moines on April 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;was sponsored by the Iowa Business Council and was similar in content and structure to Denverís.&nbsp;<strong>Governor Robert D. Ray,</strong>&nbsp;former Governor of Iowa and Co-Chairman of the Coalition, opened the meeting and set the framework for the morning discussion. Participants in Des Moines voiced similar concerns about the cost, quality and access to health care as had the Denver participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition is planning additional meetings around the country to continue to challenge Americaís most innovative, resourceful business minds to apply their collective expertise in developing possible solutions to the problems facing this countryís health care system</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Executive Briefing Series is supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GRASSROOTS EFFORT SET FOR LAUNCH</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition is poised to kick off a grassroots effort in 12 states to educate American opinion leaders, decision makers and voters on the necessity and importance of improving the American health care system. The campaign aims to make health care a top agenda item on the Congressional and Presidential elections in the year 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This grassroots effort will begin in earnest July 1, 1998, when nine field organizers are brought on to work in the following states: New Hampshire, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, California and Arizona. The Coalition is seeking candidates to organize its efforts in Iowa, Michigan, Georgia/South Carolina and Ohio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once all the organizers are in place, they will meet in July in Northern Virginia for three days of intensive education on health care issues and also on the expectations and responsibilities of this effort. This will include a thorough briefing on the five key principles of the Coalition as well as specific contacts, strategies and tactics. The organizers will focus initially on evaluating their statesí public awareness of health care issues and meeting with key contacts affiliated with our member organizations. Additional state organizers will be added in the fall to begin work in January 1999.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition is developing outreach materials, including an informational video, a consumer handbook and an organizational brochure. Also being planned is an organizational newsletter which will be issued several times a year. Additionally, a questionnaire for all candidates for this yearís House and Senate Congressional races will be sent out in June along with an information packet about the National Coalition on Health Care and the key components of health care improvement. Information from this survey will be available in September.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition will have an active presence at two national gatherings of state legislatorsóthe National Council of State Legislators convention to be held in Las Vegas during July and the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Chicago in August. Although the Coalition does not currently envision grassroots efforts focused at the state legislative level, members of state legislatures are key opinion leaders who influence key decision-makers and the voting public at large.</p>

<p>Universal eligibility for health insurance is the key to improving the health status of the American people, accordingly to&nbsp;<strong>Senator J.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Robert Kerrey</strong>&nbsp;(D-NE). How we move from universal eligibility to universal coverage is another issue, Kerrey said. His concern is with the percentage of the federal budget that is tied up in entitlements. That percentage has been growing since the 1960ís, and very little discretionary money is available to fund needed programs, including health care research and delivery.</p>

<p>Improving the quality of health care is the focus of an effort underway by the Coalition and the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI). The initiative, Accelerating Change Today (A.C.T.) - For America's Health, will identify and spread the word on innovations in health care delivery and medical practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initiative will seek out those ""best practices"" in medicine that are yielding better patient care, increasing access to timely medical care, lowering costs, making the health system easier to use, and reducing errors and inappropriate care. The selected ""best practices"" will be profiled in periodic non-technical reports. The first report will deal with medical error reduction and patient safety and will be released in June 1999. The second will center around end-of-life issues and will be published in the Fall of 1999.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reports will be widely disseminated to hospitals, doctors' and nurses' groups, managed care plans, health insurers, the media, key business and consumer groups, employer health care coalitions, and federal and state government health agencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IHI is an independent, non-profit organization based in Boston and founded in 1991. Its co-founder and president, Donald Berwick, M.D., is one of the nation's leading authorities on health care quality. A report by Dr. Berwick, As Good as It Should Get: Making Health Care Better in the New Millennium, was prepared for the Coalition and released at a press briefing on September 23, along with the announcement of the A.C.T. Initiative. The report cites numerous examples of how clinicians and health care administrators have improved care and saved money in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We are very excited about this new venture,"" said Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., Coalition president. ""Improving the quality of health care in this country must become a national priority for the 21st century. With this initiative, we hope to do our part to move towards the goal of a system that is as nearly free of errors and inappropriate and unnecessary care as is humanly possible.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of Coalition members and representatives of other organizations participated in the press briefing and voiced their support of this effort. Coalition members who spoke at the briefing included: Morton Bahr, President, Communications Workers of America; Kenneth Bloem, CEO, Georgetown University Medical Center, representing the Association of Academic Health Centers; Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, M.D., Member, Board of Regents, American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine; Walter Maher, VP, Public Policy, DaimlerChrysler; Rev.

<p><a><strong>Patients’ Rights Discussed At Coalition Meeting</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Patients’ Rights"" is a complex term that has various meanings and implications for public policy, as was evidenced in the remarks of two speakers at the Coalition’s July 8 meeting. Charles N. (Chip) Kahn, III, Chief Operating Officer and President Designate of the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA), focused his remarks on the continuing debate in Congress over the regulation of managed care and the formulation of a patients’ bill of rights. Daniel Callahan, Director of International Programs at the Hastings Center, addressed the broader, more basic issues facing our nation’s health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kahn noted that the way in which ""Patients’ Rights"" legislation has been handled in Congress has been ""abysmal."" He characterized the proposals before Congress dealing with the regulation of managed care as a ""mishmash"" of pieces with no central philosophical core. Managed care has become the ""whipping boy"" in the public’s mind for everything that is wrong with the health care system. And Congress has used that public perception to formulate ill-thought-out ""solutions,"" as Kahn sees it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kahn agreed that the nation must achieve universal coverage, but maintained that the way this goal is attained will be the sticking point. Kahn, whose Association represents the major health insurers, indicated that the insurance industry alone cannot solve the problems of coverage and cost. All parties - providers, consumers, government, health plans and insurers - have to be part of the solution, just as they are all part of the problem. Nor can employer mandates be the entire answer; some kind of direct subsidies will be needed to cover many of the uninsured he said. Kahn believes there are areas of common interest in which HIAA could work with the Coalition on seeking solutions to some of these problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Callahan noted that he has looked at the health care systems in 14 countries and concludes that all of them have serious problems. In the United States, we have no goals for our system, according to Dr. Callahan, other than ""the more we have the more we want!"" To assure patients’ rights in the broadest sense of the term, Dr. Callahan believes we need to establish a new paradigm for health care, a ""Sustainable Medicine"" model. Such a model would consist of a system that was affordable (which entails a leveling off of the rate of cost increases), equitable (universal access), and satisfying (within certain limits) to the American people. The model would incorporate the results of a close examination of the open-ended use of medical technology and therapies and would set limits on certain services. In protecting patients’ rights, we will have to come to grips with balancing the health of the population as a whole versus the health of the individual. That is not an easy task, Dr. Callahan points out, especially in a country such as the United States in which people have very high - and often unrealistic - expectations of the health care system.</p>

<p><a><strong>Raising the Medicare Eligibility Age Could Leave Many Seniors Without Health Insurance</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://nchc.org/images/pie2.jpg"" alt=""""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care commissioned a study by The Lewin Group on the ramifications of raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 by the year 2020, which is being considered among other options by the Medicare Bipartisan Commission. The study found that many 65 and 66 year olds would be left without health insurance each year under such a change unless Congress allowed those individuals to buy into Medicare and provided federal subsidies to help low-income seniors pay for the coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While most 65 and 66 year olds would probably continue to work to maintain their health coverage, many would be left without any or without adequate coverage - absent a buy-in and federal subsidies - because: (1) affordable, comprehensive health insurance is simply not available in the private, individual insurance marketplace to the vast majority of people in this age bracket; (2) seniors leaving jobs at 65 or 66 may be able to get less costly and more comprehensive ""COBRA"" coverage through their employer for 18 months, but they would still have to pay the full premium, which may be $2,000 to $4,000 a year; and (3) employer-sponsored retiree coverage is already eroding and an increase in the Medicare eligibility age could increase this unfavorable trend by inducing more employers to discontinue or cut back on health benefits for retirees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The impetus to raise the Medicare eligibility age is to reduce spending in the program (now projected to rise at 7.4% a year over the next decade) and preserve it for future generations. But the Lewin analysis, led by John Sheils, says the magnitude of the savings is uncertain. Medical costs for 65 and 66 year olds are a relatively small portion of total Medicare spending because people this age are healthier than older beneficiaries. In addition, many 65 and 66 year olds may put off costly care until they qualify, resulting in a spurt of costs among 67 year olds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, an increase in the eligibility age would reduce projected Medicare costs by up to 6% a year, and billions of dollars over many years, by (1) reducing the number of beneficiaries, and (2) inducing later retirement resulting in an increase in payroll tax revenue, Sheils says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The report,&nbsp;<strong><em>Rethinking the Medicare Eligibility Age</em></strong>, also examines the pros and cons of President Clinton’s recent proposal to allow some 55 to 61 year olds and all 62 to 64 year olds to buy into the Medicare program. It concludes that, as structured, the buy-in would have little impact on reducing the number of uninsured in this ""near-elderly"" population, now around 3 million. The main reasons: (1) the plan limits 55 to 61 year olds who could buy-in only to those displaced from jobs because of corporate downsizing or forced early retirement; (2) it requires such ex-workers to pay a premium of around $400 a month; and (3) it requires 62 to 64 year olds to pay a premium of $300 a month. Few seniors could afford the premiums, the study concludes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The President’s plan could also lead some large employers to drop their health benefit plans for early retirees, according to the study. Employers would do so on the assumption that the early retirees would have access to the Medicare buy-in. Some companies, however, could choose to give their retirees an increased pension payment to pay a portion of the costs for the Medicare buy-in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Rethinking the Medicare Eligibility Age</em></strong>&nbsp;is the first of five studies the Coalition is funding this year to analyze problems in and challenges facing the Medicare program. All are being conducted by The Lewin Group, a private health care research firm based in Fairfax, Virginia. Copies of the Study are available from the Coalition.</p>

<p><a><strong>MSAs, NOT A PANACEA</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are unlikely to have broad public appeal or solve the deepening problems in the health care system such as the growing number of uninsured persons and the rising cost of medical care, according to Jack Meyer, President of the Economic and Social Research Institute. Meyer, who co-authored a study for the Coalition,&nbsp;<strong><em>The Role of Medical Savings Accounts in Health System Reform</em></strong>, and spoke at the July 8th Coalition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>meeting, reaffirmed that MSAs are not a panacea for the major health care problems that our country faces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MSA concept, as described by Meyer, is an alternative form of health coverage that involves a combination of catastrophic (high-deductible) health insurance with a savings account that is used to pay for non-catastrophic medical expenses. Meyer said that although MSAs may be attractive to a limited number of individuals who are able to incur a large deductible and are healthy, the concept will not benefit uninsured individuals whose family incomes and health status are not conducive to this kind of approach. Meyer was also concerned that, if lower-income individuals purchased MSA coverage, they might forgo or delay needed care to preserve their MSA savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meyer noted that MSAs are likely to encourage risk segmentation, appealing to relatively healthy people, while leaving sicker people in more comprehensive plans, resulting in higher premiums in those plans.</p>

75,"Trends in Adopting EHR Systems","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Ami Patel</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an era where technology has seemingly permeated the majority of our lifestyle, the health system continues to struggle with the application and utilization of information technology to create a more efficient and accessible system. The implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) seems like a no-brainer solution to organize the health system, especially in a world where technology has replaced traditional forms of organization and communication with spreadsheets, emails and apps. Then why is the American health system still struggling to adopt a widespread EHR? The answer lies in a fragmented system characterized by a continuum of provider care ranging from traditional, small physician practices to larger, high-tech health centers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is understood people have varying thresholds for adopting innovations, and the healthcare system is a prime example of this theory. In 2002, one in five office based physicians had EHR systems, and by 2011 the adoption rate tripled amongst physicians. Providers saw the value in EHRs for organizing their patient’s medical history for more coordinated care, and also in providing a backup system during emergency scenarios where paper records could easily be lost. The challenge to creating a uniform adoption of EHR’s is in identifying the late adopters and targeting those physicians who are not comfortable with deviating from traditional charts and paper records. A&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2012/04/19/hlthaff.2011.1121.abstract"">Health Affairs article</a>&nbsp;explored various physician characteristics in relation to adopting an EHR. The trends that surfaced revealed non-primary care specialist, physicians fifty-five and older, and physicians in small (1-2 providers) practices were slower to adopt EHR’s. These slower rates can be attributed to federal polices that narrow their aim to increase technology use amongst primary care providers. Initiatives by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology have provided centers of support for the training and use of an EHR for primary care providers, but there are no comparable programs aimed at non-primary care physicians who consistently indicate a lower rate of adoption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is anticipation of a younger generation of providers who will increase EMR adoption, but the shift will be gradual. Nationwide initiatives for spreading the EHR system need to expand to non-primary care physicians and small practices in order to narrow the gap in adoption and utilization rates. Despite the progress made in Health IT, the rhetoric of incorporating technology into healthcare should diffuse into all sectors of medical practice in order to achieve uniform use.</p>

<p>The rising cost of healthcare is one of the greatest economic, fiscal, and moral challenges facing the United States, not just for the next four years, but also for coming generations. Successful efforts to simultaneously improve quality and outcomes while “bending the curve” of healthcare spending must be a top national priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where We Stand Today</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite substantial progress reforming the health insurance market and reshaping healthcare delivery in the past six years, current trends are not promising for America’s older adults, or the population as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undoubtedly, the United States has benefitted from an unexpected slowdown in health spending growth and the fact that more than 90 percent of the population is currently insured. But that fortuitous slowdown has largely ended, with spending climbing again at a rate well above inflation and wage growth, albeit not as high as historical norms. The reality is that the cost of Medicare and Medicaid will consume increasing shares of our economy and our federal budget in the years and decades ahead. Any resurgence of healthcare spending growth will only accelerate the impact of an aging population on health spending. And as Medicare costs grow, so will the premiums paid by beneficiaries, a development which will negatively affect their ability to afford care—with the greatest immediate impact on the 5 percent of beneficiaries, who generate 50 percent of healthcare spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the non-Medicare population, the situation is no better. Recent analyses of the employer market and the non-group market show rising premiums and rapidly climbing deductibles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this trajectory, future generations of Americans will find it increasingly difficult to afford the care they need. Faced with these affordability barriers, Americans will experience higher rates of illness, disability, and early&nbsp;mortality than they otherwise might. Unless we act, this combination of poor health and the increasing cost of care will gradually erode our standard of living—until the security provided today by programs like Medicare, and the American dream of generational progress, both vanish under the growing burden of healthcare costs.</p>

<p>Something unexpected is happening in Washington. As most eyes track partisan battles over immigration and the Affordable Care Act, key Congressional committees have been quietly advancing truly bipartisan legislation to strengthen Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When one of every three health care dollars is wasted on care that does not improve patients’ health, transitioning away from volume-based reimbursement would be momentous. Few policy changes are more fundamental to containing health care costs and protecting the solvency of Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The challenge in Congress has shifted from getting a bipartisan agreement on new cost controls to paying for the repeal of the old one. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of the Senate version of the bipartisan repeal bill at $149 billion over 10 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offsets that can’t get enacted are easy to dream up. Some Democrats want automatic rebates from prescription drugs used by Medicaid patients. They might also extend cuts to Medicare’s provider payments under sequestration as they did in the unemployment bill. Some Republicans want the offsets to come from cuts to Obamacare or through medical malpractice reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Congress wants to actually strengthen Medicare, not just argue about it, lawmakers must take a page from last year’s Murray/Ryan budget negotiations and focus on steps both sides can agree on because they cut waste:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bundle payments.</strong>&nbsp;Today’s a la carte, fee-for-service payment structure rewards providers for the volume of tests and procedures they order rather than the overall quality of care they provide. This misalignment of incentives has led to expensive, disjointed, and often mediocre-quality service as well as wide price variation in the treatment of the same conditions. Bundling Medicare payments for all services related to certain common hospital procedures creates powerful incentives to improve care coordination while lowering costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Improve medication adherence.</strong>&nbsp;Patients who take their medicines as prescribed are less likely to develop serious conditions requiring hospitalization. In 2012, CBO changed its methodology for scoring legislation related to medication adherence, concluding that a 5 percent increase in the number of prescriptions used by Medicare patients will lower spending on physician and hospital services by 1 percent. It makes sense. Congress should align incentives in Medicare Parts C and D to improve medication adherence, including synchronizing prescription fills, improving care coordination, and ensuring that plans who invest in strategies to lower costs also share in the savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Improve patient safety while lowering costs.</strong>&nbsp;In 2005, Congress stopped payments for certain hospital-acquired conditions (HAC). For example, if a patient was admitted to a hospital for the flu, but then fell and broke her hip under the hospital’s care, Medicare no longer would pay for the broken hip because it was preventable. Starting this year, hospitals with high rates of HACs will face an additional penalty. Yet the top five HACs alone continue to cost Americans $10 billion a year. Congress can help tackle this costly epidemic by learning from current initiatives, expanding over time the number of conditions to which penalties apply, and providing additional incentives to improve patient safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Put smarter curbs on unnecessary readmissions.</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding recent progress toward lowering patient readmissions to hospitals, current Medicare policies are falling short. They encourage some providers to perform extra care on patients instead of preventing patients’ problems from getting worse. Worse, as currently designed, penalties against avoidable hospitalizations can pull resources away from safety net providers. Congress can increase the equity and effectiveness of these policies by broadening the conditions tracked and by ensuring providers are compared with those serving similar populations. At the same time, expanding readmissions policies to post-acute and other providers could produce billions in budgetary savings.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiate a better deal on Medicare services.</strong>&nbsp;Medicare reimbursement for services like laboratory tests, certain categories of durable medical equipment, and post-hospital nursing home stays exceed prices in the private marketplace. Taxpayers should not be stuck with higher bills due to noncompetitive pricing. Aligning payment with the private sector, through some combination of competitive bidding or payment adjustments, could save billions more in health care costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Admittedly, policy changes this nuanced do not make for easy sound bites. But as part of bipartisan SGR reform, they could make Medicare a better deal for beneficiaries and taxpayers, and strengthen the program for generations to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s something even today’s divided Congress should be able to get behind.</p>

82,"Three Steps Congress Can Take To Accelerate Medicare’s Delivery Transformation","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>in&nbsp;<em>Health Affairs&nbsp;</em>blog</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John Rother and Larry McNeely</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pace of change in the United States’ health care system is accelerating. Building on work by private and public payers, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials are pursuing a transformation of how our health care system pays for care, spurred on by the passage of last year’s bipartisan sustainable growth rate (SGR) reform legislation and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell’s own payment reform goals. The destination is a wholesale transition away from the incentives for volume over value inherent in fee-for-service medicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even as recent press coverage and HHS announcements suggest that reform is picking up speed, providers and plans are facing significant speed bumps. It’s time that Congress give providers and plans the tools needed to deliver on the promise of better care at lower cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be sure, HHS’ efforts are promising. On July 7, regulators offered up a draft Medicare physician payment rule which bolstered reimbursement for care coordination and planning and covered diabetes prevention programs. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) has announced sweeping tests of bundling and medical home models. Secretary Mathews Burwell has already deployed the Affordable Care Act’s expansion authority to implement elements of the Pioneer Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Demonstration and the Diabetes Prevention Program. And this November 1, after sorting through 3,874 public comments, CMS will issue its final rule implementing payment incentives for physicians and clinicians to participate in alternative payment models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet the truth is that the underlying Medicare law was built for a purely fee-for-service system. And as alternative payment models evolve and grow, they are encountering significant statutory barriers to their success — barriers that only Congress can bring down.</p>

85,"The Seven Deadly Sins of the Prescription Drug Affordability Market","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By: John Rother</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem of unaffordable prescription drug prices is not a simple on, nor is there a single policy that addresses the full range of issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to fix the current broken system to make drugs more affordable while maintaining incentives to discover important new cures.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven “deadly sins” that now characterize the broken market for pharmaceuticals in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are practical solutions for each.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely high launch prices&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem: new medicines are sometimes priced out of reach for those who need them, even if the drug is effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sovaldi, an extremely effective and important cure for millions with Hepatitis C, was initially priced at $1000 per pill at launch, for a total cost of over $100,000 per treatment episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;This proved unaffordable for most people who need treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;New biologic drug treatments, such as those for cancer, are also frequently priced above $100,000 per treatment episode, even when the drug adds just a few days to life expectancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxturna, the new gene therapy for a rare form of blindness, is priced at a jaw dropping $850,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such prices, combined with high insurance deductibles and limitations mean that out of pocket costs too often bankrupt families.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of lives are lost due to unaffordable prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: Base prices on comparative effectiveness and affordability, as determined by an objective, independent third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurers would negotiate to pay at this level, and patients could not be charged more.&nbsp;Very high prices could be subject to arbitration where both manufacturer and purchaser submit a bid based on evidence of effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, we should cap out of pocket costs for patients who need high-priced drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular annual or twice yearly increases which compound prices over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem: Initial prices, even those based on value, escalate when manufacturers raise prices at frequent intervals, quickly resulting in prices divorced from value. Pfizer announced arbitrary price increases for over 40 drugs last week, on top of previous regular increases. Insulin has tripled in price since 2003 even though it was first discovered almost 100 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three leading insulin manufacturers have “shadowed priced” regular price increases in lockstep so as to defeat any competition based on prices.&nbsp;Epipen, which many schoolchildren need to treat asthma, has been increased in price 500% since it was first introduced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution:&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit price increases that are not based on demonstrated changes in effectiveness. Insurers would pay no more than increases reflecting general inflation without evidence of increased effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases above this level would trigger tax penalties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of transparency</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem: purchasers and consumers don’t know what the basis for the asking price is or what its value is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparative effectiveness studies, which compare the new drug to existing therapies, are not disclosed.&nbsp;&nbsp;When only one party has the relevant information, the price reflects market power, not value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebates to certain purchasers hide true prices and are not public, making any true price comparisons impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebates based on a percent of list price actually create an incentive to increase list prices so that the rebate is also increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: require disclosure of comparative effectiveness information when the drug is first launched, or track effectiveness and adjust price after one year based on documented impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Require justification for high prices and price increases as a condition of coverage.&nbsp;Purchasers should move away from reliance on secret rebates in favor of discounts to achieve a more transparent and open competitive marketplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticompetitive actions to delay generic competition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem: brand manufacturers sometimes exploit legal and market mechanisms to delay generic competitors, using such tactics as refusing to provide samples, pay for delay, orphan drug status, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: Enact the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/340/all-actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22congressId%3A116+AND+billStatus%3A%5C%22Introduced%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=31&amp;overview=closed"">CREATES</a>&nbsp;legislation to ensure availability of samples for generic competitors, prohibit pay for delay, and tighten orphan drug approvals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate practices that reward legal gamesmanship instead of a more predictable path to affordably priced generics.&nbsp;&nbsp;FDA Commissioner Gottleib is working to limit such abuses, but his authority is limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress must act to strengthen the competitive marketplace and promote the ability of generic drugs to lower prices on a predictable schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole manufacturer price gouging</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;a single remaining generic manufacturer can hike prices without restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most notoriously, Martin&nbsp;Shkreli bought the patent rights to Daraprim when there was only a single manufacturer left for it, then increased the price per pill overnight by over 500%.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 120 generic drugs listed as recently or currently facing manufacturing shortages – one third of those had price increases as manufacturers took advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: Permit importation of such drugs when excessive price abuses occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA can also expedite approval of another generic competitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;A coalition of hospitals has launched a nonprofit drug company –&nbsp;<a href=""https://civicarx.org/"">Civica Rx</a>– to fight price increases resulting from generic drug shortages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent abuses</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;generic competition delayed for years by small changes designed to get new patent extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This defeats the balance established by the 1973 Hatch/Waxman legislative framework to assure innovation is balanced with affordability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Humira, currently the best-selling brand drug in the US, has filed over 300 patent extensions that have the effect of protecting the manufacturer’s monopoly well beyond the intended 7 year patent life established in law.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is to freeze out generic competition even when much less expensive generics become available in other countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: Enact patent reforms for prescription drugs to establish a date certain for generic competition to begin, as was the original intent behind the Hatch-Waxman reforms that balanced the twin goals of affordability and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighten the standards for patent extensions so only significant improvements result in extended monopoly protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug companies spend more on stock buybacks and TV ads than R&amp;D</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;High prices generate revenue that goes first to other uses beyond research and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;TV ads drive unnecessary use of expensive drugs, driving up costs.&nbsp;Almost all physician organizations, including the American Medical Association, have long opposed direct to consumer drug advertising because it tends to override the physician’s professional judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexium is a prominent example, where ads drove patients to request the brand drug even when a much less expensive generic made by the same company was available. On stock buybacks, Pfizer spent $139 billion on buybacks and dividends over the past decade compared to a total of only $82 billion on R&amp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Major drug companies now spend much more on marketing and other business expenses than on developing new therapies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solution: change the business tax deduction for drug advertising, or limit direct to consumer advertising entirely as almost all other countries do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower the rewards for “me too” drugs by price negotiations based on what works best for the most serious conditions in order to refocus innovation on our most important health care needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish rewards other than high prices for truly innovative drugs that make significant contributions to public health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the American public now demanding effective action, it’s important that Congress doesn’t miss the opportunity to address each of “the seven sins” above.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to make the market work by rebalancing the mutually important goals of innovation and affordability. New drugs are only effective when patients can afford them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to take a big picture look at the ways the prescription drug market is broken and bring it forward into the 21st Century.</p>

86,"The Role of Nurse Practitioners in Primary Care","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Jake Lewitz</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, there is a vast division between the demand of primary care and the ability to supply such care. With the Affordable Care Act’s promise to provide health insurance for over 30 million Americans in the near future, experts predict an increase demand for primary care. However, the American Medical Association estimates that there is a shortage of 91,000 primary care physicians in the United States.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;Nurse practitioners (NP), which are nurses with graduate degrees and advanced skills, provide a solution to this problem. With lower training costs and nearly all the same abilities of general practitioners (GP) for routine primary care, NPs provide a solution to the void in primary care.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn2"">[2]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State policymakers are the most capable individuals for addressing this issue because they control nurse practitioners’ scope of practice. Today, 14 states and the District of Columbia allow nurse practitioners to practice at their full capacity.&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn3"">[3]</a>&nbsp;In these areas, NPs can prescribe medication without the oversight of a physician. This alleviates the strain on GPs to address the rise in demand for primary care alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 14 states, and the District of Columbia, that have allowed NPs to prescribe medication have demonstrated that expanding the scope of practice of nurse practitioners does not compromise quality.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn4"">[4]</a>&nbsp;Rather, there is compelling research that suggests nurse practitioners deliver better quality care because they are able to allot more time to each patient.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn5"">[5]</a>&nbsp;Improved communication and the ability to relay health information with common terminology also contribute to the success of nurse practitioners.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn6"">[6]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NPs cost less because they cost less to train. Instead of costly medical school, NPs receive a degree through a one to two year graduate program. At this rate, it is possible to educate three to twelve NPs at the price of one GP.<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-role-of-nurse-practitioners-in-primary-care-2/#_ftn7"">[7]</a>&nbsp;As a result, hospitals and clinics can see more patients at a fraction of the cost and expect higher revenue. Continuing to expand the scope of practice for NPs in other states will ensure patients have greater access to care at a lower cost without sacrificing quality.</p>

<p><em>President, National Coalition on Health Care</em></p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The price of pharmaceuticals has been a top policy issue in the U.S., especially since the introduction of the $1000 per pill Hep C drug Sovaldi in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drug prices are a top concern for Americans going into the fall elections. The issue is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-01-21/high-cost-prescription-drugs-campaign-issue"">driven</a>&nbsp;by the impact of expensive drugs on out-of-pocket costs. While there have been several proposals in Congress to reform drug pricing, none have moved forward to date.&nbsp; This article will discuss the elements of the U.S. debate and then compare leading proposals to the experience in Germany.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Price Trends for U.S. Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, drug pricing is often opaque due to nature of U.S. patent law and the commercial distribution agreements between manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and other distributors.&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. patent law gives manufacturers of brand name drugs a monopoly over a product for several years, meaning there is often little market competition to influence prices.&nbsp; The manufacturer sets list prices based on what the market will bear, not on any objective measure of value or comparison to comparable treatments.&nbsp; Further, list prices usually do not reflect prices actually paid by purchasers due to discounts, rebates, coupons, and other mechanisms. There are indirect measures of prices paid by purchasers, however, and they are the most reliable indicators of a true “price”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The situation is further complicated by the fragmented employer-based health insurance system in the U.S.&nbsp; Even the largest employers lack market power to negotiate drug prices on their own, so they use PBMs to negotiate on their behalf.&nbsp; PBMs use formularies that play one drug against others in the same class, and either structure cost sharing or deny coverage altogether as a way to manage utilization.&nbsp; PBMs do not disclose the results of these negotiations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Employers have also resorted to high-deductible insurance plans in an effort to manage costs.&nbsp; However, very high deductibles often exceed family savings, creating very serious access issues even for those with insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three distinct price trends that make generalizations about prices difficult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, the generic market in the U.S. dominates the volume of prescribed drugs, but not costs. &nbsp;Generics are, for the most part, inexpensive, and the market is relatively competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generics&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/2019-09/AAM-2019-Generic-Biosimilars-Access-and-Savings-US-Report-WEB.pdf"">make up</a>&nbsp;90% of prescribed drugs, yet only account for 22% of total pharmaceutical costs. Over the past 10 years, average prices for generic drugs have actually&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/assets/680/679022.pdf"">decreased</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, there are branded drugs under patent protection.&nbsp; They may be subject to competition from other drugs for the same condition. The price for a brand drug is often discounted once other brand drugs for the same condition are introduced.&nbsp; Brand drugs as a class are subject to price changes as popular drugs go off-patent and open up to generic competitors.&nbsp; As a category, the costs for brand drugs have&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.express-scripts.com/corporate/drug-trend-report#2019-by-the-numbers"">risen</a>&nbsp;slightly faster than inflation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Picture1.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-30374""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third category of drugs is the newest and by far the most expensive – the biologics and specialty drugs. Because of their influence on out-of-pocket costs especially, they are the focus of the current debate.&nbsp; These drugs can only be administered by a physician via injection – they are not pills.&nbsp; Most of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/Costs%20of%20Cancer%20-%20Final%20Web.pdf"">recently introduced</a>&nbsp;biologics are cancer therapies, with prices in excess of $100,000 U.S. per year (€89,114). The category now also includes gene therapies that have tremendous promise to cure some childhood genetic conditions, but which have been priced at over $1,000,000 for a treatment.&nbsp; These drugs are still rarely used, but their price tags have generated concern as they become more widely used and produced. As of 2017, specialty medicines&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.iqvia.com/-/media/iqvia/pdfs/institute-reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2017-and-outlook-to-2022.pdf?&amp;_=1591984845711"">approached</a>&nbsp;50% of spending across institutional and retail settings and represented the largest proportion of new medicines launched in the preceding 5 years.</p>

<p>U.S. consumers pay a relatively high proportion of the cost of drugs out-of-pocket, although how much varies widely according to the insurance coverage a person has.&nbsp;What a person pays out-of-pocket is the major factor driving the politics of pharmaceutical pricing.&nbsp; Press coverage of people who are having severe difficulty paying for needed medications is distressing to most Americans, who believe that no one should be denied life-saving treatments.&nbsp; The challenges of those who cannot afford insulin for their diabetes, for example, is a frequent subject of media&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/opinion/letters/drug-prices-united-states.html"">coverage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://oversight.house.gov/investigations/investigation-of-skyrocketing-prescription-drug-prices"">congressional hearings</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result is a historically high level of demand for change among almost all segments of the U.S. population.&nbsp; Even with the pandemic, concern for the cost of treatments continues to be high – among the top priorities as people look to government for solutions.&nbsp; Recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/308036/report-increase-cost-prescription-drugs.aspx"">public opinion polls</a>&nbsp;are indicative of the persistent concern that most Americans have about the cost of pharmaceuticals.</p>

<h3>State and Private Proposals to Address Drug Pricing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The political power of the pharmaceutical industry has succeeded to date in delaying effective measures designed to control costs.&nbsp; That power is based on a combination of very substantial campaign contributions to political candidates, literally hundreds of paid lobbyists, industry disease groups that push for cures and defend manufacturers, and the concern that price restraints might impair the research and development investments that the industry claims are the keys to future therapeutic breakthroughs.&nbsp; Of course, the pandemic only reinforces the industry message that price restrictions could slow the efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 or even cures for it.&nbsp; I will not analyze these claims here, but simply note that they have been effective in blocking effective legislative action to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the lack of congressional action, many of the states have&nbsp;<a href=""https://khn.org/news/states-pass-record-number-of-laws-to-reel-in-drug-prices/"">moved</a>&nbsp;to address pharmaceutical pricing. Even large states have only weak purchasing leverage on prices.&nbsp; They are precluded by federal law from direct price regulation, so they have been limited to various initiatives to require transparency by manufacturers.&nbsp; As of last year, a total of 33 states have&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nashp.org/rx-legislative-tracker/"">enacted</a>&nbsp;measures to address pricing and access issues. They range from authorizing the importation of drugs from Canada to establishing oversight boards to review the prices the state will pay for certain drugs.&nbsp; The most typical state legislation is to require drug manufacturers to disclose the basis for pricing decisions, such as the cost of development for the drug or the comparative effectiveness calculation that could justify&nbsp;a high launch price.&nbsp; The industry has challenged most of these efforts in court, and evidence of effectiveness in terms of price impact is so far missing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Private-sector employers carry the most direct cost burden for pharmaceuticals, given the employer-based health coverage system in the U.S.&nbsp; Employers have not been aggressive, however, despite the rising price tags they face for drugs.&nbsp;Most importantly, even the largest businesses have only a small share of any given market and thus no real bargaining power.&nbsp; They also have been reluctant to limit coverage of certain drugs due to employee resistance. Even legislative advocacy has been muted because most are ideologically opposed to greater regulation (in general).&nbsp; The business community is not united behind any particular policy remedy, and they have other priorities for their advocacy efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most visible effort to generate evidence-based comparative effectiveness and affordability data is the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER).&nbsp; ICER reviews the comparative effectiveness of new and expensive drugs and assesses their affordability to the health system.&nbsp; Their work is attacked by the industry because ICER uses&nbsp;Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as a measure of affordability, even though ICER uses a very generous standard of $200,000 per QALY to assess affordability.&nbsp; Industry has succeeded in prohibiting federal health and research agencies from doing comparative effectiveness analysis, and therefore ICER is funded entirely by philanthropy.&nbsp; The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can consider only safety and effectiveness, not affordability, in approving new drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Federal Legislative Proposals</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the ineffectiveness of competition, state, or private efforts to address unaffordable drug prices, federal legislation is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Last year, two comprehensive measures were introduced, one in the House and one in the Senate, that have become the focus of debate.&nbsp; The measures share some components, and they each share some with the White House’s statements about elements it would support.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chart below&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.mcdermottplus.com/insights/the-overlap-of-drug-pricing-proposals/"">illustrates</a>&nbsp;these overlaps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":30377} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Picture1-3.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-30377""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The House proposal, H.R. 3, is the most comprehensive.&nbsp; It was passed by the House on December 11, 2019, on a largely party-line vote.&nbsp; The bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set prices for the costliest drugs on the basis of an international reference price standard.&nbsp; It would enforce these prices by using the tax code, thereby ensuring that prices would be effectively constrained for all purchasers, both public and private.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bill proposes that the Secretary “negotiate” prices for the most expensive 25 drugs to Medicare in the first year, based on their price and volume. &nbsp;The second year, up to 50 drugs would be subject to negotiations. Eventually, up to 250 of the costliest drugs would be subject to price negotiations each year.&nbsp; The starting point for negotiation would be a price no higher than 1.2 times the average price of the same drug in six other advanced countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the UK). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An international reference proposal replaced the original final offer arbitration proposal backed by the Speaker, as progressive Democrats did not trust that process to be either timely or as effective.&nbsp; Commercial arbitration has a generally poor reputation among the progressive Democrats for consumer redress for defective products or unfair practices. &nbsp;Out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries would be limited, as would year over year price increases to no more than general inflation. &nbsp;According to cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, this bill would save about $450 billion in drug spending. It would finance the addition of dental, hearing, and vision benefits to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The House bill has been opposed by the White House and has no chance of being considered in the Senate this year.&nbsp; However, it will be a strong basis for Democratic candidates to campaign on this fall.&nbsp; If former Vice President Biden is elected and the Democrats take the Senate, presumably this would be a top priority for early action in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Senate bipartisan proposal is more limited.&nbsp; Senators Grassley and Wyden, the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019.&nbsp; This bill was reported from the Finance Committee in July 2019 with bipartisan support, although a majority of Republican members opposed certain elements. Republicans are particularly wary of the limits on year over year price increases. However, unlike the House bill, the Senate proposal limits year-to-year price increases only for drugs in the Medicare program. &nbsp;It requires rebates back to Medicare from manufacturers for any price increases that exceed inflation. It does not address either the initial launch price of a drug, or the prices paid by commercial purchasers.&nbsp; It would cap out of pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries and restructure the Part D drug benefit to make it more affordable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, initial&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/system/files/2019-07/PDPRA_preliminary_estimate.pdf"">estimates</a>&nbsp;of this legislation would lower out of pocket costs by $72b over 10 years, lower insurance premiums by $1b, and lower federal spending by $95b. Despite support from the President, various consumer and employer groups, and some Republican senators, the legislation lacks majority support within the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader, Sen. McConnell, who controls which measures are brought forward, has refused to bring it to the floor for consideration by the full Senate without that support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Prospects for Action in Coming Months</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic has created uncertainty in every aspect of life, including the functioning of Congress.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Senate bill could move later this year as an amendment to other “must pass” legislation.&nbsp; There are obvious political benefits to supporting a drug pricing bill just before elections, and concerns about the potential expenses associated with the pandemic may well add to the public demand for action.&nbsp;Further, Gilead, the manufacturer that produces remdesivir, released a statement on the pricing arrangement of the drug. Remdesivir is a live-saving, anti-viral treatment for COVID-19, and the Coalition&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Statement-on-remdesivir-price-07012020.pdf"">stands</a>&nbsp;strongly against the high price of the drug.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, bipartisan cooperation is rare just before an important election. &nbsp;More likely, legislators will await the outcome of the election, when presumably a stronger Democratic majority can push some version through to enactment.&nbsp; Partisan considerations are least important immediately following an election, making early 2021 the most likely time for legislative action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With drug prices in the U.S. so much higher than the rest of the world, and with very strong public demand for action, it seems inevitable that Congress will act.&nbsp; As the overlapping graphic showed earlier, there are common elements to the proposals already on the table, and compromise seems quite possible.&nbsp; Ideas from successful efforts in other countries, such as comparative effectiveness studies and arbitration, could play an important role in the final negotiations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The politics of health policy in the U.S. have typically led to incremental, step-by-step reforms designed to avoid strong opposition from powerful stakeholders.&nbsp; Truly comprehensive reform is thus difficult and rarely achieved absent the perception of a crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Comparisons to the German System</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Germany has many important similarities to the U.S. health insurance system.&nbsp; It has multiple private sector health insurance plans and is seen as a successful model that avoids a heavy-handed government role.&nbsp; Germany prioritizes patient choice and availability of innovative drugs.&nbsp; Pharmaceutical prices in Germany are considerably lower than U.S. prices, without restricting the availability of new therapies. The U.S.&nbsp;<a href=""https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-has-higher-drug-prices-than-other-countries-111256"">spends</a>&nbsp;$1,011 per capita on drugs compared to $686 in Germany. Finally, the German system seems to have gained acceptance among the pharmaceutical industry and other key stakeholders as one that promotes innovation and works well for patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To move forward with a similar approach, the U.S. would need to address several barriers. We lack certain key elements that are the basis for the German system.&nbsp; First, the U.S. has no public agency that assesses comparative effectiveness of new drugs compared to existing therapies.&nbsp; Second, the U.S. lacks broad familiarity with final offer arbitration outside of professional baseball salary negotiations.&nbsp; Consumers and their advocates are suspicious of arbitration. &nbsp;Finally, policy makers lack the credibility to make difficult trade-offs on behalf of all Americans, as the current response to the pandemic has demonstrated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonetheless, I believe the success of the German system provides a constructive model for Congress as it inevitably confronts the need to take action on drug prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;The challenge is great, but it is primarily a political one.&nbsp; Greater efforts are needed to explain the German system to Congress and health advocates.&nbsp; If key stakeholders can see the German system as one and they can accept, then it will be important model for the compromises that must be made in the name of innovation and affordability.</p>

<p>Astounding health and economic disparities pre-date the pandemic; existing disparities have only been further exacerbated by the pandemic. Systemic underinvestment and discriminatory practices such as&nbsp;<a href=""http://file//C:/Users/Michael%20Budros/Dropbox%20(Healthsperien)/Shared%20Client%20Work/National%20Coalition%20on%20Health%20Care%20(NCHC)/Communications/Op-eds%20and%20blogs/COVID%20op-eds/%C2%A7%09https:/www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/04/09/why-are-blacks-dying-at-higher-rates-from-covid-19"">redlining</a>&nbsp;mean that Black communities are more likely to be densely populated, lack healthy food options and recreational spaces, and have lower access to health care services. These conditions contribute to&nbsp;<a href=""http://file//C:/Users/Michael%20Budros/Dropbox%20(Healthsperien)/Shared%20Client%20Work/National%20Coalition%20on%20Health%20Care%20(NCHC)/Communications/Op-eds%20and%20blogs/COVID%20op-eds/%E2%80%A2%09https:/www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full"">higher rates of chronic conditions</a>, including obesity and kidney disease, among people of color – conditions that exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 disease. According to Brookings, Black Americans represent about one fourth of all public transit users and a large share of essential workers, such as 30% of bus drivers and 20% of food service workers. These jobs often cannot be done from home, increasing exposure risk. Furthermore, these jobs were hardest hit by the recession.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The impact of the pandemic on communities of color goes far beyond health care. The pandemic is also a criminal justice issue, for example. Overcrowding has made poorly prepared prisons and jails&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.vox.com/2020/11/12/21562278/jails-prisons-texas-covid-19-coronavirus-crime-prisoners-death"">epicenters of the pandemic</a>, which has a disproportionate impact on people of color. Prisons and correctional facilities have had&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/11/12/934363254/pandemics-deadly-toll-behind-bars-spurs-calls-for-change-in-u-s-jails-and-prison"">high numbers of cases</a>&nbsp;and have had to grapple with a shortage of masks and medical equipment. One study&nbsp;<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249"">found</a>&nbsp;that the case rate for prisoners was 5.5 times higher than the US population case rate. Despites calls to reduce the number of people in jails or prisons in the early days of the pandemic, few states took steps to do so. Incredibly,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.vox.com/2020/11/12/21562278/jails-prisons-texas-covid-19-coronavirus-crime-prisoners-death"">80% of those who died</a>&nbsp;from the virus in Texas county jails had never been convicted of a crime. Since Black Americans are more likely to be incarcerated or held in jail because of cash bonds, the high case rate in prisons has a significant impact particularly on Black people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solutions to these historic problems must be multi-faceted, extensive, and focused on upstream social determinants. Dr. Anand Parekh, Chief Medical Advisor of the Bipartisan Policy Center, stated at The Path Forward event that we must “learn the lessons that come out of the crisis that we are in right now… [and] make sure we invest in public health and fund and address social determinants of health.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our health care system should be more pandemic-resistant. In doing so, we can avoid exacerbating health disparities and help close existing ones. In the short-term, the federal government should extend substantial support to the states for public health efforts, economic stimulus and unemployment, and vaccine delivery. In addition, the federal government should create&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/ensuring-people-have-medicaid-coverage-they-need-during-economic-crisis"">automatic triggers</a>&nbsp;that adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) based on economic markers. The states that receive the additional federal funds for Medicaid purposes must maintain Medicaid eligibility, thus helping to ensure low-income Americans continue to receive healthcare during economic downturns. Creating these funding triggers for recessions would make sure that low-income communities are protected without delay.&nbsp;<a href=""http://file//C:/Users/evelienvangelderen/Documents/Non-School/NCHC/_https:/www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full"">Longer term solutions</a>&nbsp;include investing more in minority communities to improve access to healthy foods, education, transportation, healthcare services, and housing, as well as reforming the criminal justice system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, the medical and public health establishment must continue its work to rebuild its trustworthiness. The medical community has a long history of mistreating communities of color. For example, black patients are&nbsp;<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28178717/"">less likely</a>&nbsp;to have a trusting relationship with their physicians and medicine, in part due to heinous examples of exploitation and discrimination (such as the Tuskegee syphilis study and the maternal mortality epidemic that disproportionately impacts Black women). The science of vaccine development may prove to be a relatively simple task compared to building the solidarity and trust necessary to make them effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel. As Dr. Beverly Malone, President and CEO of the National League for Nursing, expressed at the Path Forward event, “this is an opportunity to make a difference and reimagine.” We must use the lessons we have learned from the pandemic to address deep seated inequities in health. Only by taking these inequities seriously will our health care system, economy, and communities return stronger and more resilient than they were before.</p>

You can find it&nbsp;<a href=""http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/374495-system-wide-changes-in-health-delivery-is-an-urgent-and-necessary-task"">here</a>&nbsp;on The Hill’s website.</em></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today health care is not achieving its potential for individuals or the population as a whole. However, it seems that some large purchasers of health care are now ready to reject this model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a long-time advocate for older Americans and now leader of an organization representing health care providers, payers, and purchasers, I am increasingly optimistic that we can make significant progress, despite political gridlock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three areas offer the vast potential for improvement: promoting prevention, strengthening chronic care coordination, and curbing prescription drug costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, our&nbsp;<a href=""https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tailoring-Complex-Care-Management-Coordination-and-Integration-for-High-Need-High-Cost-Patients.pdf"">fragmented, uncoordinated</a>&nbsp;system misses<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AEI-20Nov17-full-color.pdf"">&nbsp;opportunities to improve outcomes and lower costs</a>. What’s needed is a more holistic look at how to maximize health, both for populations and individuals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our current system, preventative care is too often foregone.&nbsp;<a href=""http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302908"">Prevention services are underfunded</a>&nbsp;and are often an afterthought for health care organizations focused on generously-reimbursed acute care services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our health care system just is not set up to manage the multiple chronic conditions many of them face, especially for the<a href=""https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st354/stat354.shtml"">&nbsp;five percent of the population</a>&nbsp;that accounts for fifty percent of the costs. It fails to help patients and their families navigate a complex, expensive web of coverage and providers. It fails to give actionable health and health care information to consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It fails to produce and empower sufficient numbers of primary care physicians who could better treat the needs of the whole person. Instead, our approach is to wait until patients must be rescued by skilled, but often uncoordinated and always expensive specialty and acute care services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To add insult to the injury, prescription drug costs are rising as new, expensive drugs focus on narrow patient populations and prices climb for older drugs. No wonder that&nbsp;<a href=""https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/many-drug-prescriptions-go-unfilled/"">31 percent of patients simply do not fill their prescriptions</a>. Countless others never get their first refill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care must change. We have to engage, empower, and treat the whole person, not just one body part at a time. We need health care professionals who can provide high quality care at reasonable costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need care teams that include nurses, pharmacists, and mental health counselors as well as physicians. We need a system for tracking outcomes through electronic records so that we know what works and who needs follow up services. And finally, we need convenient care that is close to the patient and available to them on short notice and off hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the private sector, the headline-grabbing commitment of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-health-care.html"">Berkshire Hathaway, JP Morgan Chase, and Amazon</a>, along with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/business/dealbook/cvs-is-said-to-agree-to-buy-aetna-reshaping-health-care-industry.html"">CVS Health’s proposed acquisition of Aetna</a>, have real potential to shake up the system in ways that address these shortcomings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything depends on execution. But if these new entities harness their purchasing power, their technology, their community presence, and their frequent interactions with patients, they can become the type of positive disruptors that actually walk the talk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They can deliver on the promise of preventative, convenient health. They can advise patients on lower cost generic alternatives to brand name drugs. They can track medication adherence, reminding patients to keep current.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, disruptive delivery models like CVS Health-Aetna are working with primary care practices. This can help coordinate care and avoid harmful or unnecessary services for the chronically ill. This is the type of private sector innovation we need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving forward with system-wide structural changes in health delivery is an urgent, national task. We will need stronger federal and state leadership—but amid today’s political paralysis, we can’t afford to wait for progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will be the first to hold these private sector actors to account if they don’t deliver, but I will also be the first to applaud if they succeed. More importantly, patients and their families will finally start receiving what they need and deserve.</p>

<p>You can read the published op-ed on The Hill&nbsp;<a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/440521-is-arbitration-an-answer-for-high-drug-prices"">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Future prescription&nbsp;<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.aha.org/2017-12-11-high-rising-drug-prices-myth-vs-fact"" target=""_blank"">drug costs are projected to spike to unsustainable levels</a>. Biologic pharmaceuticals will make up the majority of new drugs, and unfortunately,&nbsp;<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424364/table/T68/"" target=""_blank"">they are commonly priced at over five figures for a course of treatment</a>. These drugs promise new breakthroughs in treatments for patients with certain targeted conditions, but at prices few can afford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare in particular needs new tools to better balance the incentives for new drug development with our ability to afford them. Despite recent, negative news coverage many health-care professionals would argue that one of the best solutions is to adopt a tactic that is already in use in other sectors of the economy — binding arbitration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbitration is a formal process for a buyer and a seller to resolve a price dispute by making their respective cases to an impartial, third-party arbitrator. The arbitrator chooses which “final offer” proposal to adopt, which creates incentives and encourages both the manufacturer and the purchaser to bargain in good faith to reach a settlement before the arbitrator handles the dispute. Arbitration can thus serve as a middle ground between government setting prices and the current “what the market will bear” practices of manufacturers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In circumstances where extreme pricing power exists, such as the launch of new therapies protected with market exclusivity, binding arbitration provides a much needed counterbalance to drug manufacturer’s extreme price setting power. Countervailing buying power is necessary to balance the power of sole suppliers.&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/3-r-frank-issues-in-drug-price-negotiation-using-binding-arbitration-3/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Right now, Medicare and other purchasers have little to no bargaining power for high-cost drugs with few substitutes, but with arbitration, Medicare could use its power in a limited set of circumstances where competition doesn’t exist.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know that other countries are already utilizing binding arbitration as a method to regulate pharmaceutical prices. More importantly, we know that using arbitration to establish drug prices works. In 2010, Germany passed the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/english/statutory_health_insurance/amnog_evaluation_of_new_pharmaceutical/amnog_english.jsp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act (AMNOG)</a>, mandating the use of binding arbitration to set prices for certain classes of drugs when negotiations fail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AMNOG established a successful process for assessing the value of new drugs using comparative effectiveness research conducted by a non-governmental institute. The German AMNOG process appears to be working without stifling access,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/english/statutory_health_insurance/amnog_evaluation_of_new_pharmaceutical/amnog_english.jsp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">with more than 300 drugs assessed over approximately seven years and less than 30 drugs being withdrawn from the market from May 2018 to March 2019.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Congress decides to move forward with arbitration&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/democrats-feud-over-drug-pricing-policy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">as Harvard professor Richard Frank suggests</a>, policymakers will need to specify a number of factors in order for the process to prosper: the type of drugs included, the criteria used by an arbitrator in evaluating price, and the time period for negotiation. Congress also needs to amend the “non-interference clause” in the Medicare Modernization Act to clear a pathway for arbitration over Medicare Part D drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While binding arbitration isn’t the sole remedy for managing unsustainable drug prices, it can serve as an essential element to help rebalance the incentive for medical innovation with the need for meeting affordability demands. In order to ensure that hard working Americans can afford life-saving drugs, Congress members must fulfill their obligations to constituents by considering arbitration as a solution to the monopolization of the most expensive pharmaceuticals in our country.</p>

<p><em>This commentary piece by NCHC President and CEO John Rother was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=""http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/366162-ending-chip-will-permit-chronic-conditions-to-grow-in-prevalence"">The Hill</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This fall, a decade-long campaign to trim federal health spending managed to successfully disrupt federal health care programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, the target fell on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), community health centers (CHCs), and chronic disease prevention programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These essential initiatives weren’t the enemies that spending hawks set out to confront. Nor will their disruption amount to the hoped-for victory over long-term federal spending growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was this simply a miscalculation at the bargaining table? Were the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/annual-chip-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"">8.9 million kids on CHIP</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/healthcenterfactsheet.pdf"">26 million health center patients</a>&nbsp;accidentally pulled into the melee when broader legislation regarding Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act sputtered this summer? To some degree, yes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But something else is at work here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The idea that government&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/sen-ron-johnson-federal-spending-americas-biggest-problem/"">spending, particularly federal spending, is the nation’s central policy problem</a>&nbsp;is increasingly influential. Unfortunately, this narrative, regardless of its merits in other policy arenas, just isn’t that helpful in fixing our health care spending problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, the diagnosis, that federal health care spending is out of control, is too narrow and over simplified. Health care costs are indeed escalating, but those increases are driven by complex dynamics playing out across the public and private sides of the health system&nbsp;— not only in federal health care programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, the usual prescription, that we cut spending on health and safety net programs whenever and wherever possible, ends up treating the symptom of health care spending in ways that exacerbate the underlying causes of the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s actually ailing America’s health system is this: The combination of rent-seeking in the marketplace and government subsidies for inefficiency and waste has swelled health costs across public and private sectors, even as it has undermined efforts to combat non-communicable chronic conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of rent-seeking and wasteful subsidies span the health system. The persistence of volume incentives in Medicare provider payment exemplifies how we directly subsidize inefficiency. Gaming of patent and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.gphaonline.org/media/cms/REMS_Studyfinal_July2014.pdf"">FDA laws</a>, which allows brand name drug companies to keep generic competitors out of the marketplace, is a classic case of private actors preserving their ability to charge unjustified rents, through manipulation of the machinery of government.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>time that lawmakers take this condition seriously — if they hope to relieve the pressure on family budgets and on federal taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A serious treatment strategy requires applying a scalpel to a complex set of misguided policies and waste generating behaviors that have metastasized across the health sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But its application is not easily accomplished in today’s environment. Serious bipartisan policy making loses out to, on one side, a knee-jerk skepticism about even the most worthwhile public initiatives and, on the other, the instinct to oppose any effort to trim those public programs when they are under siege.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus we find ourselves where we are today. After funding expired three months ago, CHIP and community health centers are only now getting a temporary reprieve. Cuts to chronic disease prevention programs, specifically those funded through the Prevention and Public Health Fund, appear to be the budgetary pay-for most acceptable to Congressional majorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Viewed solely from the lens of federal spending, attacking any of these programs is a futile and counterproductive gesture. 2016 expenditures on CHIP&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/total-chip-spending/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"">($14.5 billion</a>), CHCs&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43937.pdf"">($5.1 billion</a>), and the entire CDC (<a href=""https://nchc.org/funding/documents/fy2016/fy-2016-ofr-budget-appropriations-snapshot.pdf"">$16 billion)</a>&nbsp;are a drop in the bucket when compared to the trillion in federal dollars spent on health care overall. Disrupting these programs won’t meaningfully reduce federal spending, but it will permit chronic conditions to grow in prevalence. This could actually exert upward pressure on Medicare and Medicaid spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Viewed from a health system-wide lens, the consequences are even worse. Curtailing these valuable programs will likely drive up employer costs as employees become sicker and less able. Absenteeism already&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/worker-illness-and-injury-costs-us-employers-225-billion-annually"">costs employers $225.8 billion a year</a>&nbsp;and a growing number of sicker employees will make that problem worse.&nbsp;<a href=""https://bus.wisc.edu/~/media/bus/knowledge-expertise/academic-departments/asrmi/events/2016-2017/2016-12-09-gwyn-pauley.pdf?la=en"">Medicare and Medicaid costs will grow</a>&nbsp;as more kids enter adulthood with untreated or undertreated chronic health conditions. And as our public health and prevention programs atrophy, chronic disease<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/TL221_final.pdf"">, the very thing driving health spending</a>, is free to grow unchecked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children’s health insurance programs are sending cancellation notices. Community clinics and public health programs are disrupted. These are not small government outcomes. They are not conservative outcomes. They are just bad outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be battles to fight over the proper balance of market forces and public action in health care in the years ahead. In the meantime, let’s not allow programs like CHIP, community health centers, or CDC chronic disease prevention to become collateral damage.</p>

<p>As drug prices continue to <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health-news/prescription-drug-prices-have-gone-up-this-year"">rise</a>, policymakers debate drug pricing reform.

Yet, Germany <a href=""https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/germany"">has</a> a similar health care system to the United States. The government has a limited role in the delivery of care and workers usually receive insurance through statutory health insurance paid for by both the worker and the employer. Further, patients are responsible for copayments and deductibles. The German model affirms that drug prices can be lowered in a privatized health care system.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He argues, correctly, that drugs often save money for the health care system.&nbsp; We believe that medicines can be one of the best and most cost-effective interventions in health care and, of course, cost-effectiveness can’t be the only lens we apply to new innovation.&nbsp; For example, there are many very expensive drugs for rare diseases that simply can’t be cost-effective, but as a society we understand we have to pay the price for innovation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem that Sovaldi has spotlighted is that some companies are attempting to charge rare-disease prices for medicines that will be used by many, many people.&nbsp; In Sovaldi’s case it will be used by many millions in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Castellani attempts to redirect blame for the problem to payers, but the real issue is the total cost to the system.&nbsp; Whether the cost is embedded in government or employer subsidies, premiums, or co-pays, the cost is the cost and the trend for high-priced medicines is on a collision course with reality.&nbsp; Pointing fingers won’t solve the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Castellani closes his post by calling for a “much broader conversation” on the ways we can create a sustainable health care system that will carry us into the 21<sup>st</sup>century, while also protecting patients and encouraging innovation.&nbsp; As the head of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), a nationwide alliance spanning multiple industries and comprised of over 80 employers, providers, consumer, and public health groups, we recently launched a campaign to encourage such a dialogue.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.csrxp.org/"">Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing</a>&nbsp;welcomes the opportunity to discuss this important issue with the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; We believe that by focusing on quality, proven results, and the utilization of comparative effectiveness research, our health care system can reap the benefits of advances in not only medicines, but new technologies, medical techniques, and coordinated models of care.</p>

104,"Takeaways from a year of health care disruption","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 2018 now underway, the National Coalition on Health Care has been reflecting on the tumult of the past year and what we have learned. There has been so much going on in health care and health policy, much of it negative, that it’s difficult to form a simple assessment of the possible impact going forward.&nbsp;Here are ten significant observations as&nbsp;we reflect back on 2017:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Affordable Care Act</strong>’s reforms of individual insurance markets survived, even though weakened by the repeal of the individual mandate and the Administration’s regulatory actions designed to undermine the ACA. Ironically, individually-purchased insurance plans are now even more dependent on public subsidies as more are eligible for premium support.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Medicaid&nbsp;</strong>not only survived, but emerged politically stronger than ever thanks to the vigorous public debate over “repeal.” The future of health delivery innovation shifted to state Medicaid programs, where varieties of managed care now predominate. The big questions now are the fate of the program in non-expansion states and whether Congress reduces the overall federal support for the program in future budget battles.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Health care spending growth</strong>&nbsp;overall remained modest, with the notable exception of pharmaceuticals. Although we have seen increased approval of generics at FDA, lawmakers continue to face strong public and purchaser pressure to break the legislative logjam which has, for at least a decade, protected Pharma’s unsustainable pricing practices. Unjustified pricing practices at launch and post-launch price increases will receive increased public scrutiny. Greater transparency will be the likely first step toward a solution.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The move from&nbsp;<strong>paying for volume to paying for value</strong>&nbsp;is now widely supported at the rhetorical level. However, operationalizing these reforms is proving difficult and the Administration has slowed the pace of alternative payment model growth in Medicare. Restarting progress, at CMS and in the marketplace, is essential.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Medicare</strong>‘s future is increasingly tied to Medicare Advantage (MA), despite recent criticism about narrow networks and transparency as to their quality and composition.&nbsp;Over 50% of new enrollees chose Medicare Advantage last year.&nbsp;It’s increasingly clear that the future of Medicare lies with a well-functioning Medicare Advantage program.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Employers continued to limit their own costs by&nbsp;<strong>cost-shifting to employees</strong>. Without far more impactful payment reforms or significant progress on provider and drug pricing, employers will be forced to keep shifting to high-deductible plans. Access and affordability are now at risk, not just for the uninsured, but for people enrolled in these high-deductible plans. Health coverage alone is no longer an adequate indicator of access or affordability – even from a major employer.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Health care organizations consolidated</strong>&nbsp;at a rapid pace, presumably to increase their market power. Some mergers, like the CVS purchase of Aetna, have the potential to transform the way health care is delivered by better integrating care. But overall, these mergers threaten to reduce the role of physicians in favor of hospitals and insurers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Health care costs</strong>&nbsp;are now dominated by treatments for those with chronic conditions, but our financing and delivery systems have not adapted. The role of social determinants is now better understood, but too few organizations are seriously investing in remedies. Support for prevention and population health initiatives remains weak, despite growing evidence of long-term value.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Health care delivery</strong>&nbsp;varies greatly across the country, as NCHC’s series of health care summits have demonstrated. Instead of a national system, we are confronting regional systems that are quite distinct and increasingly urbanized. Rural health care is eroding quickly.&nbsp;The role of telehealth and clinics staffed by advanced practice nurses is increasingly important for those distant from major health resources.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Regrettably,&nbsp;<strong>leadership in confronting all these issues is weak</strong>. The Administration and current Congressional Majority have yet to articulate a coherent policy. The Democrats don’t yet have a credible or powerful voice that can mobilize support beyond protection for the status quo. The health sector is divided and concerned with short-term issues. The lure of single payer threatens to monopolize the attention of progressives, while conservatives seem unable to agree amongst themselves as the “replace” efforts demonstrated.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given these observations, it’s clear that the challenge of moving toward a more affordable, sustainable system that offers good care for all remains. A unifying policy consensus is lacking, so no wholesale solution is likely to prevail. Instead, we may anticipate a more fragmented set of developments in health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question before us – and it is an important one – is whether those developments lead us forward or backward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving a system of this size and complexity forward will require joint action by all those involved in delivering, paying for, and receiving needed care. It will require cooperation by policymakers with very different end goals for American health care. But the National Coalition on Health Care is committed to making progress wherever we can. We challenge leaders of all political stripes and all those with a stake in the future of health care to join us in that effort.</p>

<p>Why should we care about the Farm Bill? Isn’t it policy that supports America’s farms and farmers? Well partially, but it also influences food policy: the availability of certain foods, prices, clean drinking water, chemical-free healthy food, food stamps, etc. It covers a wide range of issues that will, in some form, affect you and your health.</p>

<p>August 12, 2011</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Shelley Jazowski</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent post, I commented on the safety of generic medications specific to product labeling. Safety concerns are not singular to generics, but pervade the drug development, manufacturing and marketing components of the overall prescription drug industry. Below, I outline three primary concerns and comment on their proposed solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Lack of Oversight of Internationally Produced Products</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This first issue is a direct result from the increased globalization of the drug development industry. Due to the economic impacts, pharmaceutical manufacturers collaborate with global partners to produce pharmaceutical ingredients or products, and this trend shows no sign of slowing. The<a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-07/phg-pfs071111.php"">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>&nbsp;estimates that 40 percent of finished drugs and 80 percent of active ingredient and bulk chemicals are imported from overseas. With this influx of internationally manufactured products comes the threat of substandard and/or adulterated materials, similar to the tainted Heparin, produced in and shipped from China, which was responsible for dozens of deaths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Accountability for the Entire Supply Chain and Standardized Regulations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution to the lack of oversight involved in the manufacture and trade of pharmaceutical products does not rest with one party, but must be equally addressed by the federal government, domestic pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies. Not only should Congress impose national standards on drug wholesalers, but lawmakers should also require the private sector to both track and verify the authenticity of pharmaceuticals. To that end, pharmaceutical manufacturers should create systems that ensure quality and safety, thus making them responsible for the entire supply chain, including improved testing, transparency and auditing. The solution would not be complete without increased inspections from the FDA and/or approved third parties. Only then would Americans be guaranteed safer and higher quality medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Counterfeit Medications</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some cases, the cause of one safety issues spurs another. Increased globalization leads to the threat of contaminated medicines, but also increases the likelihood of an influx of counterfeit drugs. Counterfeit medications can infiltrate the market, thus causing physical harm to patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Varied Color and Shape of Brand-Name and Generic Drugs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar to the how the cause of one safety issue can set off a chain reaction of subsequent harmful events, so too can proposed solutions. One such solution is the shape and color of medications. When a generic enters the market it has a different shape and color than its brand-name counterpart. The same holds true for drugs whose price has been negotiated and internationally traded according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations. The varied colors and shapes of generics are meant to deter counterfeit medications from entering the market and being traded domestically and abroad. Although the number of counterfeit medications maybe decreased, the variations in pills often&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/health/12pills.html"">prevent the elderly</a>, who are on a number of prescriptions, from adhering to medication guidelines. Thus, is this solution properly addressing the issue at hand? Is the tradeoff of decreased counterfeit activity worth the risk of compromising the health and safety of the elderly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Missing Medication Guides</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As described above, safety concerns are paramount in the drug development arena, but have increasingly crept into marketing and pharmacies. According to an<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/news/20110628/some-drugs-sold-without-safety-information"">&nbsp;investigation</a>&nbsp;conducted by Consumer Reports, pharmacies often do not include federally mandated medication guides with filled prescriptions and when the safety information is provided, it is often varied and conflicting. A major driver behind the inconsistency is the lack of a nationwide standard, similar to the Drug Facts labels on over-the-counter medications. Instead, rules are developed and set by each individual state’s pharmacy board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Patient Responsibility</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although legislation or regulations have yet to be introduced, one can hope that the results of this investigation will propel lawmakers to devise recommendations that will not only standardize medication guides and language, but also ensure that federally mandated medication guides are included for designated medications. Until lawmakers turn their attention to this safety issue, the responsibility will remain with the consumer. An informed patient is the key component to realizing adherence and guaranteeing safety, but is too much responsibility being placed on the consumer? The pharmacy should be accountable for following regulations and distributing proper safety information.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Margaret Steele<br><em>HealthDay Reporter</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>THURSDAY, June 28 (HealthDay News) — Supporters of the Obama administration’s health care reform law said Thursday that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the landmark legislation protects the health of millions of Americans, but critics claim it does so at the expense of key civil liberties and exacts a high economic toll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 5-to-4 ruling “means millions of Americans can look forward to the coverage they need to get healthy and stay healthy,” Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This decision protects important improvements, such as ending coverage denials due to preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on insurance, and allowing the 2.5 million young adults up to age 26 who gained coverage under the law to stay on their parents’ health insurance policies,” Lazarus said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already, about 54 million Americans are benefiting from expanded preventive and wellness care coverage, Lazarus noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But many of those who oppose the legislation fear the federal government is intruding into the lives of private citizens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m disappointed that the Court is willing to give the federal government the power to tell you what has to be in your health care plan down to your contraceptives and mammograms,” said John Goodman, president and founder of the National Center for Policy Analysis. “That’s a great deal of power.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Economically, the Affordable Care Act “is one reason economic recovery has been so anemic,” he suggested. Although hours worked across the United States are now what they were before the recession, hiring is not at pre-recession levels, he said, attributing that lag to “Obamacare” insurance requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The mandates come with a big price tag for employers and employees,” Goodman said. The cost of family coverage works out to $6 an hour, he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether for or against the law, experts voiced relief that a decision was reached.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re very relieved and eager to move forward from here now that we have some certainty,” said Dr. Glen Stream, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The law’s comprehensive primary-care initiative ensures funding for important health practices related to the “medical home” approach, he said. Preventive services, such as wellness coaching, dietitians and electronic record-keeping programs, are now accessible to many Americans through public and private payers, he noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit, according to Stream, is the provision for primary care work-force training. “Federally qualified community health centers have the capacity to train family physicians, which is critical,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now we can work on other meaningful reforms,” he said, mentioning liability reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alison Renner Manson, manager of government affairs and policy for the National Coalition on Health Care, predicted that Congress has some hard work ahead. In some ways, the ruling was only the tip of the iceberg, she noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The decision upholds existing law, so we’re not looking at major changes,” she said. “A lot of decisions on health care need to be made over the next year that will have a larger impact.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, even with the Affordable Care Act in place, as much as one-third of U.S. health spending benefits no one’s health, Manson said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s an ongoing problem we have to deal with one way or another,” she said. These issues include unnecessary or duplicated tests and services, excessive administrative costs, and instances of fraud and abuse, she explained. “We want to get more for our health-care dollars, but we don’t want people to go without services,” she said. And for that to happen, consumers, politicians and policy makers will have to work together, her group believes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the court decision upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act under a constitutional tax provision, there could be surprise financial implications, some say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said in a statement that she anticipates financial obstacles as a result of the ruling. AHIP is a Washington, D.C.-based trade association representing the health insurance industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The law expands coverage to millions of Americans, a goal health plans have long supported, but major provisions, such as the premium tax, will have the unintended consequences of raising costs and disrupting coverage unless they are addressed,” she noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Health plans will continue to work with policymakers on both sides of the aisle to make coverage more affordable, give families and employers peace of mind, and promote choice and competition,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Figures reviewed by AHIP indicate that the minimum essential health benefits requirement “will result in less affordable coverage for individuals, families and small employers by forcing them to ‘buy up’ and purchase more coverage than they may want or need,” she added.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever the Supreme Court does on Thursday, there’s no time machine for the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Legally, a ruling reversing or eviscerating the Affordable Care Act could bring the country&nbsp;<a href=""http://nationaljournal.com/member/magazine/what-fills-the-void-if-the-health-law-falls--20120524"">back to 2009</a>. But practically, there’s no going back. In the two years since the health care legislation became law, big players in the industry have begun reshaping their business practices, changing their structures, and altering the rules of play in ways that will be difficult to reverse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/member/magazine/how-the-health-law-could-raise-prices-20120216?mrefid=site_search&amp;page=1"">Hospitals have begun buying</a>&nbsp;up medical practices and their smaller competitors. Insurance companies have been moving toward new payment paradigms and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/member/healthcare/insurers-will-keep-parts-of-obama-health-law-regardless-of-court-ruling-20120611?mrefid=site_search"">promising to preserve</a>&nbsp;new consumer protections.&nbsp;<a href=""http://nationaljournal.com/member/magazine/the-costs-of-undoing-health-care-reform-20120517"">State governments have overhauled</a>&nbsp;their Medicaid enrollment systems and insurance oversight. The health care ruling will be consequential in numerous ways, but there is much that the law has set in motion that is likely to outlive it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What the Supreme Court does tomorrow could accelerate the move toward a more affordable, more competitive, more efficient health system or could decelerate it,” Larry McNeely, manager of policy, advocacy, and communications at the National Coalition on Health Care, said on Wednesday. “But I wouldn’t say that it’s going to change the direction.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While implementation of the government-run parts of the health care law are on a long timeline, the health care industry has not waited for the 2014 deadlines to come—or the Supreme Court to issue its decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the lead of Medicare and existing private pilots, more insurers are tying payment to quality—asking doctors and hospitals to hit certain benchmarks or share in financial risk. Hospitals have begun transitioning to large health care systems. These new models may have been spurred by changes in Medicare payment policy, but contracts have been written and signed, meaning both sides of those deals have begun restructuring for the new reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(<strong>FULL COVERAGE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=""http://nationaljournal.com/court-decision-health-care"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">The Court’s Health Care Ruling</a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, Aetna announced a new partnership with Inova Health System in Northern&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/healthcare/health-care-ruling-won-t-stop-all-of-industry-s-changes-20120627"">Virginia</a>, in which the insurer and provider would share profits 50-50. Dr. Charles Kennedy, Aetna’s CEO for accountable-care solutions, said that his company had been working toward new payment models before the law passed, but has seen things speed up since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Affordable Care Act “is certainly a significant help in terms of getting organizations to go down that path,” he said. “That said, we have developed strategies where we can make these types of approaches successful even when it’s just Aetna.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across the country, hospital mergers have accelerated since 2010, and hospitals have also sped up their purchases of physician practices, leading an increasing number of doctors around the country to become health care system employees. Executives say that these consolidations are necessary to provide more integrated care required by the new payment paradigms. Even if those conditions change, the mergers will be difficult to unravel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parts of the insurance industry have also embraced popular consumer protections included in the law. They have not gone so far as to promise that, without a legal requirement, they will take any customer who signs up. But three of the country’s largest private insurers — UnitedHealth, Aetna, and Humana — have said that they would hang onto lower-cost, highly popular provisions, like including young adults on their parents’ family plans and offering preventive services without co-payments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These benefits are not expensive, but, even so, they were not company policy before the law started requiring them. “The market had not demanded that,” said Paul Keckley, executive director of the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, who said that the health reform law changed public expectations. “It became a very popular item to add that didn’t cost a lot of money.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many states have also&nbsp;<a href=""http://nationaljournal.com/member/magazine/the-costs-of-undoing-health-care-reform-20120517"">been taking action</a>. The health law offered them big grants to help update the computer systems used to enroll residents in Medicaid. Even in the group of states fighting the law, most have taken some money to begin replacing their 30-year-old computers with modern systems that will make it easier to enroll beneficiaries and coordinate with other social-service agencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s operational. It’s not political,” said Heather Howard, director of the Health Reform Assistance Network at Princeton University, which is advising 10 states on how to get ready for health reform. Howard said the infrastructure changes will have lasting impact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>States that have embraced the law have gone further, taking steps toward setting up the regulated marketplaces demanded by the law. Several have&nbsp;<a href=""http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-06-19/health/bs-hs-surpeme-court-health-law-20120619_1_health-care-reform-law-hilltop-institute-maryland-braces"">vowed to move forward</a>&nbsp;with that process, retaining the national law’s framework for insurance sales and regulation, even if the law is reversed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Supreme Court eliminates the entire law, or invalidates key provisions, the decision will reverberate widely. Such a ruling will almost certainly lead to a vast reduction in the number of Americans who will obtain health insurance in 2014. But even if the law is gone, it has created a template that has shaped business strategy and state regulation. Those effects will endure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are a range of market changes that were unleashed by the reform act,” said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Avalere Health, an industry consultant. “These are all things that will persist, irrespective of the court’s ruling.”</p>

<p><strong>Broad Alliance of Health Groups Releases Plan to Lower Costs, Improve Care</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>New NCHC Plan Would Trim Deficit and Enhance Health Care Affordability</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/"">National Coalition on Health Care</a>&nbsp;(NCHC), a broad national alliance of consumers, providers and payers, released a plan for health and fiscal policy at the National Press Club in Washington today.&nbsp; The plan pairs nearly $500 billion in spending reductions and health-related revenues with longer-term policy changes designed to make health care affordable in the public and private sectors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As America moves from the campaign season to actual governance, we offer a path forward, drawn from the best ideas of both parties, that can both reduce the deficit and make health care more affordable” said&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/node/1183/"">John Rother</a>, NCHC’s President and Chief Executive Officer.&nbsp; “More than a budgetary challenge, the question we face is a moral one—whether we can act to keep health care affordable today and for future generations.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 50-page plan, entitled&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/node/1273/""><em>Curbing Costs, Improving Care: The Path to an Affordable Health Care Future</em></a>, outlines a seven-part strategy to dramatically increase the value Americans get for their health care dollars:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp; Change provider incentives to reward value, not volume;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp; Encourage patient and consumer engagement;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp; Use market competition to increase value;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4.&nbsp; Ensure that the highest-cost patients receive high-value, coordinated care;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5.&nbsp; Bolster the primary care workforce;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6.&nbsp; Reduce errors, fraud, and administrative overhead; and</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7.&nbsp; Invest in prevention and population health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s event also included representatives from some of the stakeholder groups that helped shape NCHC’s approach:&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/people/george-diehr/"">George Diehr</a>, Vice President, CalPERS Board of Administration and NCHC Board Chair;&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/node/1181/"">Jack Lewin</a>, MD, consultant and former medical society executive; and Debra Whitman, Executive Vice President, Policy and International for AARP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event’s speakers distinguished the NCHC plan from other proposals that are driven more by budget calculations than health policy. According to Diehr, “Just picking a budget number and slashing federal programs to reach it only shifts costs to the private sectors, states, or the most vulnerable.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC’s recommendations do include $220.97 billion in reduced federal spending and $276 billion in health-related revenue.&nbsp; However, NCHC proposes pairing these identified budget savings with broader systemic reforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ten-year budget savings have to be coupled with strategies for long-term sustainability: transitioning from fee-for-service, engaging consumers in their care and coverage choices, investing in our non-physician workforce as well as doctors, and crafting a medical liability system that supports patient safety,” said Former U.S. Senator&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/node/1065/"">David Durenberger</a>, past chair of the Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Health and a member of NCHC’s Board of Directors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC’s plan developed from a year of bimonthly, off-the-record discussions with key health experts and a diverse range of stakeholder groups.&nbsp; According to Rother, “We learned that curbing costs while improving care is possible if consumers, payers, and providers alike are ready to embrace changes in how our health system operates.”</p>

118,"<strong>1995 Health Care Forums on Business Strategies</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; Following the 1992-94 health reform debate, the National Coalition on Health Care concluded that public education was a vital ingredient missing from the national dialogue on health care reform. The Coalition responded by developing a program designed for senior business leaders in Atlanta, GA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, Boston, MA, and Chicago, IL, in a series of Fall 1995 forums. These colloquia, co-sponsored and funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, addressed the issues of cost containment, quality care, and consolidation within the health care delivery system at the national, regional and local levels. The morning session focused on private sector issues and cost containment strategies used by local business leaders. The afternoon session examined the rapidly changing landscape in the local health care delivery systems, featuring representatives from local HMOs and hospital networks. The session concluded with a discussion of the increasingly serious issue of quality health care and outcomes research. To attract an audience comprised of CEOs, CFOs, senior vice presidents for compensation and benefits, and directors of human resources, the Coalition worked cooperatively with the Pacific Business Group on Health, the New York Business Group on Health, Northeastern Universityís College of Business Administration, the Midwest Business Group on Health, and with Coalition members Southern California Edison Company and R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company. The conferences were standing-room-only, with a total of 1,200 participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The overwhelming response was due in part to the caliber of speakers who the Coalition attracted, including President Jimmy Carter, Fran Bastien of Digital Equipment Corporation, Dr. Chris Bisgard of Delta Airlines, Lawrence English of CIGNA HealthCare, Mark Goldberg of the Yale School of Management, Fred Hamacher and Ed Wingate of Dayton Hudson Corporation, Margaret Jordan of Southern California Edison Company, Dr. Lucian Leape of the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. David Lawrence of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Dr. George Lundberg of the Journal of American Medical Association, Dr. Arnold Milstein of the Pacific Business Group on Health, Susan Moriconi of Hewlett-Packard Company, Dr. Richard Nesson of Partners HealthCare System, Inc., Charlie Pryde of the Ford Motor Company, Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University, Dr. Steven Schroeder of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Dr. David Skinner of The New York Hospital and Dr. John Wennberg of the Dartmouth Medical School.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coalition developed the Executive Briefing Series in response to feedback from previous conferences. The sessions were structured to focus beyond the immediate cost issues surrounding the provision of health care benefits to include a broader unde rstanding of the meaningful role that business has in determining the nationís future health care environment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coalitionís Denver meeting was co-sponsored by the Kauvar Foundation and the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver. Attendees included CEOís, Chairmen, Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who gathered at the University of Denve rís Phipps Mansion for a four-hour session on March 31<sup>st</sup>. The meeting began with welcoming remarks by&nbsp;<strong>James D. Griesemer, Ph.D.,&nbsp;</strong>Dean of the Daniels College of Business, and&nbsp;<strong>Abe Kauvar, M.D.,</strong>&nbsp;Founder and President of the Kauvar F oundation. The session was facilitated by&nbsp;<strong>Michael Maccoby</strong>, President, Maccoby Consulting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants voiced concern about rising health care costs, a lack of public understanding of health care as a ""system,"" a need for universal insurance coverage and a common definition of health care quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Henry Simmons</strong>, the Coalitionís President, provided the group with an overview of the current state of the health care system. During the luncheon,&nbsp;<strong>Kenneth Thorpe, Ph.D.,</strong>&nbsp;of Tulane University explained the rising costs of health care and the implications for business.</p>

<p>“Republicans and Democrats have finally crafted a major health care bill they can both support- and with health care costs continuing to grow, it is about time. This discussion draft once and for all would end the threat of deep cuts to physician payment that could disrupt access for the 47 million seniors and disabled Americans on Medicare.&nbsp;But as importantly, it could begin to hold down the cost of health care - by transforming how physicians and other health professionals are compensated. Instead of rewarding the number and complexity of medical tests and procedures, payment updates would depend on the quality of care and the health outcomes of their patients. To achieve those aims, physicians could opt to pursue innovative alternative payment models, such as accountable care or medical homes.”</p>

<p><em>The National Coalition on Health Care and the Moment of Truth Project have released a new paper analyzing proposed reforms to the Medicare delivery and payment systems.&nbsp; Full paper:&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Final-Delivery-Systems-Reform-Paper.pdf"">Final Delivery Systems Reform Paper</a></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Should Congress Consider Delivery System and Payment Reforms?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current volume-based reimbursement that pervades America’s health care system encourages more, not better, care and is driving up spending at an unsustainable rate. National health expenditures continue to outpace the growth of the overall economy and are projected to grow from $2.9 trillion in 2013 to $4.72 trillion by 2021.&nbsp; Federal health spending will grow from 4.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013 to 6.3 percent by 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, there is a strong need for delivery system and payment reforms in Medicare and across the health system overall. These reforms must look beyond one-time reductions in spending and cost-shifts to a fundamental realignment of incentives aimed at better care and lower cost growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What Sort of Reforms Have Been Proposed?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care stakeholders, thought leaders, and policymakers on both sides of the aisle have united around the notion that more can be done to place put health care spending on a sustainable path. This new, emerging consensus embraces three key principal strategies: 1) reward value of health care services over volume; 2) promote care coordination; and 3) inject more competition into our health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Encouraging Competition</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><em>Competitive Bidding</em></strong><em>: Expanding competitive bidding for durable medical equipment and other services</em></li>

<li><strong><em>Prescription Drug Policy</em></strong><em>:&nbsp; Remove barriers to generic competition in Medicare’s Low-Income Subsidy program</em></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Achieving Budgetary Savings from Delivery System Reform</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improved quality and better value for Americans’ health care dollars are worthy goals in and of themselves, but finding budgetary savings remains a vitally important consideration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Congressional Budget Office has found that reforms such as policies to prevent readmissions, expand competitive bidding and encourage generic drug utilization can produce “scoreable” budgetary savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other reforms such as care coordination, improved integration of care for dually eligible beneficiaries and value-based purchasing may not produce “scoreable savings” today but are worth pursuing and testing because of the potential for savings in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policymakers could consider coupling delivery system reforms with well-designed enforcement mechanisms that can both spur the transformation of health care delivery and provide some assurance of budgetary savings.&nbsp; One such mechanism is to build targeted, scoreable payment reductions into a delivery or payment reform proposal, thereby sharpening the incentives for providers to deliver higher-value, more coordinated care. A “value-based withhold” could also serve to guarantee savings from delivery system reforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While other proposed reforms to federal health care programs have proven politically challenging, a broad, bipartisan consensus is building around delivery and payment reforms, and that consensus could make them viable, realistic solutions in coming months. For policymakers who want to place our health system on a sustainable path while promoting the best care for patients, these policies are a great place to start.</p>

<p>According to Rother, “For all the disagreements elsewhere in health policy, our analysis found that consensus has formed around three bipartisan approaches that curb costs while improving care… pay providers for value over volume, promote care coordination and inject competition into our health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building on previous work on delivery and payment reform from both organizations as well as a number of other recent budget and health care proposals, the paper examines several proposed reforms to health care delivery and payment in detail and explores options to ensure those reforms can produce scoreable budgetary savings.</p>

<p>Technology has transformed our day-to-day interactions and allowed for efficient communication across long distances. We participate in virtual meetings with coworkers, instantly share photos with family through social media, and Skype friends overseas. Telehealth technologies promise to similarly revolutionize how we experience health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telehealth includes an increasing variety of applications and services that use two-way video, email, smart phones, wireless tools, and other forms of communication technology. Demand for telehealth has been growing, as it offers many potential benefits including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Broader access to providers: Telehealth services have been used for over 40 years to provide healthcare services to patients in faraway locations. Given the provider shortages now prevalent in both urban and rural areas, telehealth has a unique potential to allow patients to access healthcare professionals from a distance.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increased cost efficiency: Telehealth has the potential to lower healthcare costs and increase efficiency through better management of chronic disease and reduced length or frequency of hospital stays.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enhanced quality of care: In some cases—particularly in mental health care and ICU crises—more timely access to specialists through telehealth services&nbsp; can be crucial to positive health outcomes.</li>

<p><strong>New Massachusetts, California Initiatives Could Help Curb Costs Nationwide</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) Forum held on Capitol Hill today, Harvard economist David Cutler and William Kramer, an executive with Pacific Business Group on Health, briefed Washington stakeholders and policy-makers on the latest thinking about how to curb costs while expanding coverage from state level reformers in Massachusetts and large employers in California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With SCOTUS behind us and the fiscal cliff ahead of us, it’s clear Congress should be taking some pages out of the playbooks these states are using, ” stated John Rother, NCHC’s President and CEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cutler, a respected health economist, described the package of aggressive new payment, market, and administrative reforms nearing enactment in Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Massachusetts wants to be the leader on health costs as we were with coverage. This involves changing payment from fee-for-service to bundled care and increasing the ability of consumers to shop around on price and quality,” said Cutler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kramer noted large employers’ frustration with the pace of efforts to rein in growth in the cost of medical care, and laid out steps that Medicare and the federal government could take to turbocharge those efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Kramer, “Regardless of whether large employers supported or opposed the ACA, on the day after the Supreme Court ruling they woke up facing the same problem they had the day before: rising and unsustainable costs.&nbsp; Health reform won’t be complete until we find a way to contain the costs of our health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s event is the fourth of an ongoing series of NCHC Forums, designed to bring together thought leaders, policymakers and stakeholders for timely public discussions about the future of America’s health system.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Innovators Bring Medicare Reform Ideas to Capitol Hill</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two leaders in high quality, low cost health care delivery, Intermountain Healthcare and SCAN Health Plan, brought their ideas for Medicare reform to Capitol Hill at National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) Forum. Intermountain Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer Greg Poulsen and SCAN President and CEO Chris Wing spoke at the third in a series of NCHC-sponsored events designed to bring together key health sector innovators and thought leaders with Washington, DC policymakers and stakeholder organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Intermountain and SCAN have cracked the code in achieving real savings by improving care, not just shifting costs.&nbsp; As federal policymakers face today’s fiscal challenges, they would do well to heed their example,” said NCHC President and CEO John Rother, who moderated today’s event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intermountain Healthcare is a Salt Lake City-based nonprofit health system of 22 hospitals, a medical group with more than 185 physician clinics, and an affiliated health insurance company.&nbsp; Intermountain is recognized for its leadership in health care quality and manages to maintain per-person costs that are 43% below the national Medicare average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Poulsen outlined his organization for aligning incentives around the health of beneficiaries, rather than payment for the services they use, structured around new “Shared Accountability” provider organizations.&nbsp; According to Poulsen, “There is ample evidence that health cost and health cost growth could be significantly reduced while simultaneously improving health outcomes for Americans. Aligning incentives around value can catalyze these improvements.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founded as Senior Care Action Network by seniors in Southern California, SCAN Health Plan has become the nation’s 5th largest non-profit Medicare Advantage Plan and now operates Medicare Special Needs Plans (SNPs)focused on the needs of beneficiaries that need institutional-level care, who have severe or disabling chronic conditions or who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; SCAN’s emphasis on enhancing senior’s ability to manage their own health and encouraging independence has kept 100,000 seniors out of nursing homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The lack of care coordination for nine million Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibles is a looming crisis that threatens to overwhelm state and federal budgets and lock vulnerable populations in outdated models of care,” said Chris Wing.&nbsp; “We can and must do better.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the 25 undersigned organizations, we sincerely appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule titled,&nbsp;<em>Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System and Consolidated Billing for Skilled Nursing Facilities for FY 2018, SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program, SNF Quality Reporting Program, Survey Team Composition, and Proposal to Correct the Performance Period for the NHSN HCP Influenza Vaccination Immunization Reporting Measure in the ESRD QIP for PY 2020.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations are members of a broad coalition of beneficiary and provider advocacy groups who are dedicated to preserving Medicare beneficiaries’ access to necessary skilled nursing care following a hospital stay, regardless of whether that stay was classified as inpatient or outpatient observation. Under current law, a Medicare beneficiary must spend at least three days as a hospital&nbsp;<em>inpatient&nbsp;</em>for Medicare to cover a subsequent stay in a skilled nursing center (known as the “SNF 3-day rule”). Each year thousands of beneficiaries are unable to access their skilled nursing benefit because of the administrative classification of their hospital stay, even if the stay is deemed medically necessary, and even if the stay spans three days or more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Section VIII of the proposed rule, titled&nbsp;<em>Request for Information on CMS Flexibilities and Efficiencies,&nbsp;</em>CMS has solicited ideas for regulatory, subregulatory, policy, practice, and procedural changes to eliminate unnecessary burdens for providers and patients. Below, we offer CMS a clear pathway to resolve this problem through the issuance of subregulatory guidance, an approach that would not require the promulgation of new regulations. We also provide a legal argument showing that CMS already has the authority needed to implement the solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>CMS Has Legal Authority to Define Inpatient Care</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 2008 decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals confirms that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has authority under the Medicare statute to count the time a patient spends in the hospital, regardless of inpatient or outpatient classification, toward satisfying the SNF 3-day rule for Medicare coverage of the SNF stay2. In its decision, the Court recognized that neither the statute nor regulations define the word “inpatient,” and that the Secretary defined “inpatient” in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual as occurring after a formal physician order for admission. Although the Court upheld the Secretary’s position in litigation, as a matter of&nbsp;<em>Chevron&nbsp;</em>deference, it acknowledged that the Secretary has the authority to change the interpretation of “inpatient” to include time spent in observation as an outpatient:[W]e note that the Medicare statute does not unambiguously require the construction we have adopted. If CMS were to promulgate a different definition of inpatient in the exercise of its authority to make rules carrying the force of law, that definition would be eligible for&nbsp;<em>Chevron&nbsp;</em>deference notwithstanding our holding today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>CMS Already Has Set Precedents for Defining “Inpatient” for Purposes of Satisfying the SNF 3-day Rule</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CMS already allows certain hospital stays to count in qualifying a patient for Part A-covered care in a SNF, even when the hospital stay itself is not a Part A-covered hospital stay. We provide two examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In the context of hospice services, CMS has recognized that “general inpatient care” in a hospital, although “not equivalent to a hospital level of care under the Medicare hospital benefit,” nevertheless qualifies a hospice beneficiary for Part A-covered SNF services; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A three-day stay in a foreign hospital may qualify a beneficiary for Part A SNF coverage if the foreign hospital is qualified as an “emergency hospital.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The argument for counting days spent as an outpatient under observation for purposes of satisfying the SNF 3-day rule is far stronger than either of the above examples, since CMS acknowledges that care in the hospital is indistinguishable whether the patient is formally admitted as an inpatient or called an outpatient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, CMS already has clarified that a beneficiary stay spanning at least three days does not actually need to be Medicare-covered in order for it to satisfy the SNF 3-day rule. In describing why a beneficiary continues to be eligible for Part A SNF coverage after a hospital withdraws its Part A claim and resubmits it as a Part B claim instead, CMS wrote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>…the 3-day inpatient hospital stay which qualifies a beneficiary for ‘posthospital’ SNF benefits need not actually be Medicare-covered, as long as it is medically necessary. In addition, the status of the beneficiaries themselves does not change from inpatient to outpatient under the Part B inpatient billing policy. Therefore, even if the admission itself is determined to be not medically necessary under the policy, the beneficiary would still be considered a hospital inpatient for the duration of the stay, which, if it occurs for the appropriate duration, would comprise a ‘qualifying’ hospital stay for SNF benefit purposes so long as the care provided during the stay meets the broad definition of medical necessity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CMS concludes that a patient’s receiving “medically necessary” care in the hospital,&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>the classification of the care as “inpatient,” is the key factor for determining the patient’s eligibility for Part A SNF coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Second Circuit and CMS have recognized CMS’s authority to define “inpatient” care for purposes of satisfying the SNF 3-day rule, and CMS has exercised this authority in certain areas of the Medicare program. CMS could do so here as well, and issue subregulatory guidance in the form of an update to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, clarifying that any time a patient spends in the hospital, regardless of whether the stay is administratively classified as inpatient, outpatient, or outpatient observation counts toward satisfying the SNF 3-day rule for purposes of ensuring Medicare coverage of a subsequent, medically necessary SNF stay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations urge CMS to take action on this very serious problem and eliminate a confusing policy barrier that each year needlessly prevents thousands of Medicare beneficiaries from accessing their benefit to SNF care. Thank you for allowing us to submit our comments on this proposed rule. Please do not hesitate to reach out to James Michel at the American Health Care Association at (202)898-2809 or&nbsp;jmichel@AHCA.org, or any of the undersigned organizations if you have questions on this comment or matter.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;Affordable Care Act&nbsp;(ACA) is the wrong prescription for an improperly diagnosed problem. Consequently, whatever benefits it may provide will be greatly outweighed by its adverse side effects. They will worsen a serious cost problem and degrade senior citizens’ access to care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What ails&nbsp;US&nbsp;health care is too much third-party payment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine how the cost of food, another basic need, would skyrocket if Americans were told that government or private payers would subsidize 89 cents of every dollar spent. Instead of addressing these perverse incentives, the ACA will make them worse by expanding the amount of subsidized care and imposing federal control on decisions that most other markets leave in the hands of individuals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policies that provide the right incentives would better serve Americans – and significantly reduce the number of uninsured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In&nbsp;Medicare&nbsp;we can achieve this by switching from offering open-ended packages of defined benefits to giving beneficiaries a fixed amount of funds, which they can use to choose among a broad array of health plans. Officials have already used the same idea for more than a half decade to allow seniors to select their Medicare drug benefits; the fierce competition among plans has helped reduce such drug expenses by 30 percent over time, and by nearly 40 percent in 2011.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicaid&nbsp;can follow a similar path if Congress gives states a set dollar amount and allows them to decide how best to manage their programs – a move that would expand consumer choice, increase competition among providers, and lower costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Converting the tax exemption for employer-sponsored health insurance to a fixed-dollar tax credit for individuals that varies by income and health status would likewise avert many problems of the current system – and harness the unparalleled shopping ability of Americans to find good value for their money.</p>

<h2>2. No: The law insures millions more Americans, and it cuts costs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s tempting to cite a long list of benefits from the&nbsp;Affordable Care Act. But let’s focus on two core purposes of the law.&nbsp;First, the law makes health insurance accessible to millions who need it the most, including those with preexisting conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this access is only affordable by encouraging people to get coverage before they get sick – with both carrots (tax credits for insurance) and sticks (penalties for not having insurance). That’s how insurance works: It spreads risk across a large pool of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While most Americans already have health insurance, we’re all at risk of losing it. You could lose your job, change jobs, or be diagnosed with an illness. Over a four-year period, from 2004 through 2007, 89 million Americans were uninsured at some point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These people aren’t lazy moochers; they encounter life’s vicissitudes. To be sure, they could visit emergency rooms to get the most expensive and least timely care – which is still paid for by the rest of us.&nbsp;But this rationing of care is inhumane. Under the new law, Americans will no longer live in fear of financial ruin from health-care bills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, the law curbs health-care costs over the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The law’s reforms to the way health care is paid for and delivered encourage hospitals and doctors to provide better care at lower cost. These savings strengthen&nbsp;Medicare&nbsp;for seniors – lowering their drug costs, premiums, and cost-sharing. This month, for instance, hospitals have financial incentives to reduce preventable re-admissions – motivating them to improve care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Repeal would make Medicare insolvent in four years and, as my colleagues and I estimate, increase retirement costs by an average $11,100 for a current 65-year-old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The law’s reforms to the payment and delivery system should be expanded. But they’re already improving care, and this progress must not be rolled back.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. A middle way: Don’t re-argue Obamacare; adjust it</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real question is not whether to repeal the&nbsp;Affordable Care Act. Political rhetoric aside, leaders on both sides realize the importance of some of its benefits (covering preexisting conditions, for instance), and its initial steps to curb costs in&nbsp;Medicare. These provisions are here to stay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real question is how to further curb costs and ensure coverage is within reach for all.&nbsp;It is possible to do both. Republicans and&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;may seem miles apart today, but they have an example in Medicare, which was passed with bipartisan support and adjusted over time by leaders in both parties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, in the coming fiscal debate over deficits and debt, we can’t afford to rehash the same all-or-nothing argument between the new law and Republican proposals to give states block grants for&nbsp;Medicaid&nbsp;and to implement a premium-support model for Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care has worked with the consumer, provider, health plan, and business communities to chart a new course that controls costs and provides affordable care to all. Here’s what we learned:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare reimbursement and coverage policies have to change. Provider payment must transition from a fee-for-service model that rewards tests and procedures, to one that supports coordinated patient care. Benefits must show good value by lowering enrollees’ co-pays and deductibles when they choose high-quality providers and more effective treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reform, however, cannot stop with Medicare or other public insurance plans. We must bolster cost-saving competition in private hospital and pharmaceutical markets. To combat chronic disease, we must strengthen public investment in prevention programs and the primary-care workforce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the election, Congress will stand face to face with the “fiscal cliff” and the need to cut growth in costs. Our coalition will make specific recommendations then. For the sake of affordability and better care, let’s readjust, not re-argue, health care in America.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Delivery and Benefit Innovation Claims the Spotlight on Capitol Hill</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Innovations that curb health costs by improving care took center stage at the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) Forum on Capitol Hill today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Across this country, nurses, physicians and health plans are implementing exciting solutions that lower costs and improve care. It is time we brought these programs to scale,” said event moderator Joe Minarik. Minarik serves as a member of NCHC’s Board and as Senior Vice President and Research Director at the Committee for Economic Development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event’s panel discussion featured real world leaders who are leading successful efforts to improve health care value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joelle Frizzera, a nurse practitioner and Clinical Services Manager for Evercare Mid-Atlantic, supervises a program that relies on nurse practitioners to improve care for frail nursing home residents with complex medical needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Evercare Model is really about providing accountable care, demonstrating better quality, outcomes and satisfaction – and in a manner that treats each patient according to their best care needs and options.&nbsp; And we’re able to do this for patients in their existing care environment which means care costs are cut significantly,” said Frizzera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bill Estabrook, Executive Director of the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OP &amp;F), is responsible for the retirement and health benefits of 55,000 active members, retirees and their family members. Implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program as part of a broader health and wellness effort helped his organization achieve savings as large as 16% below previous trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The wellness initiatives in place at OP&amp;F have been popular and effective. I speak from experience as not only the CEO of our organization, but someone who was identified as high risk for Type 2 Diabetes. My coworkers and I have all benefited from the programs in place and the money spent on this initiative pays dividends in many ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Jerry Penso, the Chief Medical and Quality Officer for the American Medical Group Association, highlighted ways to help consumers and patients choose high-quality, integrated health care providers and systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Penso, “At some point in our lives, each of us will face an illness for ourselves or a loved one, so choosing the right doctor can be a critical decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet choosing the right physician is only one part of the equation—finding a high-performing health care system that supports your physician in delivering excellent care is also vital to achieving the best health.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event is the fifth of an ongoing series of NCHC Forums, which are<em>&nbsp;</em>designed to<em>&nbsp;</em>bring together thought-leaders, policymakers and stakeholders for timely public discussions about the future of America’s health system.</p>

<p>MARCH 6, 2017 BY <a href=""https://nchc.org/author/therese-pollock/"">NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>March 06, 2017 02:47 pm&nbsp;<a>Michael Laff</a>&nbsp;– New payment models and dedicated efforts to coordinate care are changing the delivery of health care, but more progress needs to be made, primary care physicians said at a recent forum on health policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Primary care has been overlooked for too long in discussions about health care reform,” said National Coalition on Health Care President and CEO John Rother, J.D., during the March 1 event in the Dirksen Senate Office Building titled “Primary Care: Its Essential Role in Value-based Health Care.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AAFP President-elect Michael Munger, M.D., of Overland Park, Kan., spelled out key areas that need improvement. For instance, the United States has much lower average life expectancy than other developed countries despite outspending all other industrialized nations on health care.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999538/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Wasteful spending in the nation’s health care system(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)</a>&nbsp;— $765 billion a year — is equal to the gross domestic product of the Netherlands. The figure includes $210 billion in unnecessary services, $130 billion in inefficient care delivery and $190 billion in excess administrative costs.</p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 26, 2014 BY <a href=""https://nchc.org/author/lmcneely/"">LARRY MCNEELY</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2010, as part of the federal health care law, Congress established a new pathway for the FDA to approve generic versions of biologic drugs, called biosimilars. Due to&nbsp;the rising&nbsp;cost burden generated by high-priced biologic drugs, biosimilars are&nbsp;a&nbsp;critical source of competition to protect the sustainability of&nbsp;our health system. Unfortunately, in state capitols around the country, efforts are underway to lessen&nbsp;the potential&nbsp;of&nbsp;biosimilars&nbsp;to bring life-saving medicines to more patients at an affordable price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The AARP Public Policy Institute shines a light on this threat to health care affordability with their new brief&nbsp;<em><a href=""https://nchc.org/content/dam/aarp/research/public_policy_institute/health/2014/the-debate-surrounding-state-biosimilar-substitution-laws-AARP-ppi-health.pdf"">A Sense of Déjà Vu: The Debate Surrounding&nbsp;State Biosimilar Substitution Laws</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

196,"Accelerating the Value-Based Care Movement","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the last half century, American healthcare has relied on a fee-for-service reimbursement system that rewards quantity of tests, procedures, and visits –not quality or outcomes.&nbsp; It’s no wonder that our health care has grown increasingly unaffordable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this is beginning to change, thanks to two decades of bipartisan leadership and most recently the overwhelming passage of Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). By aligning federal policy with the most innovative private sector and state payment reform initiatives, the transition toward value-based care is succeeding, measurably improving healthcare quality and contributing to historically low per-person cost growth. Now is the time to put our foot on the gas to accelerate the shift toward value-based care and new models of delivery and provider payment. We recommend:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<li>Encouraging public and private investment in the testing and scaling of new alternative payment models as called for under MACRA</li>

<p>TAX CREDITS NEED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 40 million Americans - one in six under 65 - have no health insurance coverage. In his State of the Union address, President Bush proposed refundable tax credits for individuals and families to purchase health insurance. Secretary Thompson offered more specifics yesterday, calling for a $1,000 credit for individuals earning up to $15,000 annually and a $3,000 credit for families with incomes under $25,000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care applauds the Administration for acknowledging the seriousness of the uninsured problem and would like to work with the Administration and members of Congress to reduce the number of uninsured. We agree that, in order to have national security, all Americans need health security. Research suggests, however, that the size of the tax credit is unlikely to make it possible for many lower-income uninsured families to purchase the health insurance they need to obtain quality health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the proponents of tax credits recognize, the high cost of health insurance is a major reason millions of lower-income Americans lack coverage. The average annual family premium in the individual health insurance market is over $7,300. With a $3,000 credit, eligible families would still have to spend at least 17 percent or more of their gross income to purchase health insurance. This is well beyond what most lower- and moderate-income families can afford. Therefore, the proposed tax credit is too small to enable most uninsured lower-income Americans to purchase coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Tax credits have a tempting appeal to expand coverage,"" says Robert Ray, Co-chairman of the Coalition. ""However, tax credits alone cannot solve the problem of the uninsured, nor are they likely to contain the skyrocketing costs of health care - with premiums rising 15 percent a year - or address the problems in the quality of care.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We believe that tax credits must be large enough to enable most lower-income uninsured Americans to buy health insurance. Tax credits should be accompanied by reforms in the individual health insurance market and other protections,"" Paul Rogers, Co-chairman of the Coalition said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""For health security, the Coalition believes all Americans need health care coverage, soaring costs need to be contained, and the quality of care needs to be improved. When that happens, we will truly reform the health care system,"" Mr. Ray and Mr. Rogers agreed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care. It is comprised of 80 member organizations, which include large and small businesses, labor unions, and consumer, physician, hospital, and religious groups. Former Congressman Paul Rogers (D-FL) and former Governor Robert Ray (R-IA) serve as the Coalition's Co-chairs.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The confluence of powerful economic forces, fueled by the terrorist attacks of September 11, have unleashed a ""perfect storm"" that could increase dramatically the number of uninsured people in the U.S. -- with as many as 6 million people in total losing their coverage in 2001 and 2002. Specifically, two forces have converged to cause this perfect storm which threatens over the long term the health coverage security of workers and their families. First, a dominant force that has been building over the last three years is rapidly rising health insurance premiums, which could lead to an additional 6 million people going without health insurance in the two-year period 2001-2002 because of the high costs of maintaining health care coverage. As startling as that number is, the accelerated rise in unemployment powered by the economic downturn and the impact of the September 11 attacks could significantly exacerbate the problem. While nearly 39 million people were uninsured for the entire year in 2000, we estimate that approximately 45 million people will have no health insurance coverage by the end of 2002, unless the government takes substantial actions to stem the incoming tidal wave of the uninsured. Further, during the three-year period 2001-2003, we estimate that a total of 86 million Americans could suffer a gap in their health insurance coverage.<a href=""https://nchc.org/EOL101200.pdf"">""Promises to Keep: Changing the Way We Provide Care at the End of Life"" October 12, 2000</a><br>(in .pdf format)<br>Edited by Pat Scheoni, October 2000</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of reports under the ""Accelerating Change Today (A.C.T.)-- for America's Health"" Initiative sponsored by the Coalition and the Institute for Health Care Improvement. The report presents nine institutions and organizations that exemplify quality in dealing with end-of-life. Many of these institutions provide services to patients through pain management and hospice care. Some provide support groups for children who have lost their parents or siblings. The practices that these profiled institutions have put in place can be used by other institutions as models to ensure quality of care at the end-of-life.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While overall health insurance premium increases of from 9-12% are expected in 2000, many small employers are experiencing 15-20% increases. When premiums rise, employers are often forced to shift more costs to employees or to cut or eliminate health benefits. Such actions, in turn, result in many workers becoming uninsured because they can not afford the additional cost of their employers' insurance or individual insurance. If a 12% increase in premiums occurs in 2000, the report estimates that an additional 750,000 people could lose their health insurance. Using the lowest projected increase of 9%, an additional 600,000 could be added to the more than 1 million who are already becoming uninsured each year.<a href=""https://nchc.org/releases/medical_errors.pdf""><br>""Reducing Medical Errors and Improving Patient Safety: Success Stories from the Front Lines of Medicine"" - February 22, 2000</a>&nbsp;(in .pdf format)<br>Edited By Steven Findlay, National Coalition on Health Care, February 2000.</p>

<p>This monograph is the first in as series of reports under the Accelerating Change Today (A.C.T.) for America's Health Initiative sponsored by the Coalition and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The report presents case studies of institutions and health care organizations that have developed important innovations in medical error reduction and patient safety. The organizations profiled have created models that have reduced some types of medical errors by 80 to 90 percent in just a few years, and yielded many important lessons such as:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Legislative solutions are needed to combat the rising cost of health care in the United States, which accounted for almost 18% of the GDP in 2017. One symptom of the problem, surprise medical bills, contributes to unpredictable, high out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Patients often encounter surprise medical bills when receiving emergency or ancillary health services from out-of-network practitioners. These providers “balance bill” patients for the difference between the full charge for services and the amount paid by the insurer, or bill for the entire amount of undiscounted charges. Payers, providers, facilities, and health consumers are all stakeholders to consider in legislation to address surprise medical bills. In protecting consumers, policymakers should not fuel health care inflation.</p>

206,"Stressed Health Care System Today Could Result in Better Care Tomorrow","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s health care institutions are stretched to capacity and beyond by the COVID-19 crisis. But like physical exercise, it’s possible that this stress can lead us to a stronger system longer-term. This depends, of course, on how we respond to the shortcomings revealed by our slow responses to the pandemic.<br>From my decades in health policy, here are my top ten lessons from COVID-19 that should change the future of health care in America:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Emergency Preparedness. Perhaps the most obvious need for improvement is in our preparations for future health care emergencies. A more adequate strategic reserve of key equipment and medications, especially personal protective equipment, and more responsive means for national distribution, would be a positive step to strengthen our ability to respond more effectively to future threats. This includes more adequate surge capacity, better planning to address new methods of care delivery (like home-based care), and closer cooperation between public and private sector entities that can contribute to emergency medical needs. Examination of why existing stockpiles have proven insufficient will also be important.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Testing and Diagnosis. The failure of the United States to quickly test large numbers of people greatly contributed to the spread of the virus and subsequent loss of life. Other countries addressed this need more effectively. A stronger health care system going forward will include a more responsive testing capacity which can then inform population health measures to limit the spread of infections. We need data. Also, we will need to retain the more flexible and responsive regulatory oversight at the FDA that was finally permitted during the COVID-19 crisis. The provisions waiving cost-sharing for testing should continue as we recognize the urgency and benefit of widespread testing – the spread of infectious disease highlights the critical positive externalities of low barriers to high-value care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Telehealth Flexibilities. Telehealth has the potential to free up our system to incorporate more efficient and responsive alternatives to face-to-face medical appointments. Barriers to telehealth use have been lifted at break-neck speed by the administration and Congress in light of this disaster. Many of these new measures should be made permanent so that patients and physicians can take advantage of new ways to interact and forego outdated methods of care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Workforce. The emergency has forced the suspension of restrictions on physician and nurse practices that are no longer appropriate. Allowing physicians to practice across state lines, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to practice to the full scope of their licenses are overdue reforms that need to continue beyond the current crisis.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Public Health Infrastructure. Our underfunded public health infrastructure has been overwhelmed. Community Health Centers, for example, are at the front lines of reaching millions of Americans, particularly those lacking insurance or the means to get treatment. That lack of capacity resulted in greater infection for the general population. The foundations of our modern economy no longer<br>allow us to isolate infectious disease to one part of our society. Other key public health institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are now receiving badly needed supplemental resources that need to continue.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Insurance Coverage. If the current crisis demonstrates anything, it’s that everyone should have insurance coverage - not just for their own protection but for the community’s. Any delays in seeking treatment, even if just a phone call to a family physician, due to lack of insurance coverage simply put everyone else at risk and could drive up total costs. This crisis is forcing a relaxation of enrollment restrictions along with a reexamination of cost-sharing requirements for critical treatment. Congress has the opportunity to build on this change by moving our system toward value-based coverage provisions that reduce costs for prevention and high value medical interventions, especially during an emergency. States that have not expanded Medicaid have the opportunity and responsibility to expand Medicaid coverage as a step to protecting the general population. Insurers may need financial support for these changes to continue, but the more generous targeted coverage provisions recently adopted need to be extended in ways that enhance access to important diagnostic services in future public health emergencies.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Outreach to Those Most Vulnerable. COVID-19 has shown how much higher risk some people are to hospitalization, disease, and death than others. The underlying causes of these vulnerabilities can often be addressed through continuation of expanded support for social service agencies. The health care system also has a role in investing upstream in social determinants of health, in order to avoid over-hospitalization. Health plan investments in nutrition, housing, and transportation, for targeted at-risk populations can be cost effective and need to be expanded. Nursing home and other senior living facilities have been particularly at risk to COVID-19. Containment strategies based on testing, isolation, and treatment could limit the spread of infection. Greater support for nursing staff and home care options are also measures that need to continue.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Mental Health. Depression, anxiety, and stress are understandable reactions to our current crisis. Social isolation is particularly difficult for many who live alone. Outreach to those people is so far inadequate, but could be expanded to build on the explosion of online efforts to engage isolated individuals who are lonely, anxious, or depressed with helpful resources. Video outreach may turn out to be a partial substitute for face to face interactions, even by individuals with minimal training. There will be a surge in demand for mental health services during and in the wake of COVID-19, as isolation extends and losses grow, in addition to those underserved already. Federal and state partnerships to expand mental health programs will be essential to a healthy future.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stronger Public Communication and Education. One of the most important lessons from our current experience is the crucial role that timely, clear, authoritative, and credible information plays to support public understanding and behavior during a rapidly evolving epidemic. Political leaders, governors and presidents alike, need to regularly communicate with the public and provide access to public health experts who can communicate complex science and uncertainty without generating panic. We need stronger norms and better models of communication for future crises, free from political agendas.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cost-containment. All these ongoing changes will be expensive but worthwhile. If we are to keep our health care system at all affordable, Congress has now the responsibility to enact cost-saving measures that can offset these needed investments. Two areas stand out because they are widely understood to embody unnecessary health care expenses: specialty prescription drugs and so called<br>“surprise bills” for out of network care, often in emergency rooms.<br>High-cost specialty drugs are driving higher costs that are unaffordable to families, employers, and taxpayers. Bipartisan proposals have been introduced to bring drug prices more in line with their value – Congress should no longer delay them. Surprise bills burden unsuspecting patients with extraordinary charges for in-hospital care by physicians not a part of the patient’s insurance network. Many states have already tried to limit this practice, but federal action is still necessary. Both situations are abusive and result in unjustified costs to patients, insurers, employers, and taxpayers. Congress needs to act to reallocate health care dollars where we really need it.<br>The current crisis presents some opportunities for strengthening our health care system going forward, but only if we build on what we are learning from the current stress.</li>

<p>As American health care transitions toward value-based models of care and payment, successful employers, plans, and health systems are finding strong primary care to be absolutely essential.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC—Growing momentum on Capitol Hill behind a permanent repeal of Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and related opportunities for broader physician payment reform drew advocates from across the health sector today to a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/"">National Coalition on Health Care</a>&nbsp;(NCHC) forum today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“2013 is the year to put the SGR behind us and move toward delivering higher-quality, well-coordinated care at lower cost,” said John Rother, NCHC’s President and CEO and moderator of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event featured a discussion about the shape of Medicare physician payment policy, post-SGR. The event speakers were: American Academy of Family Physicians’ Vice President for Policy and Practice Advancement, &nbsp;R. Shawn Martin; Vice President of the Board of Directors at American College of Cardiology, Kim Allan Williams, MD; and Premier healthcare alliance’s Senior Vice-President Blair Childs. Their presentations are available on NCHC’s website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate of the budgetary cost of SGR repeal in February, policymakers from both political parties have shown interest in combining an SGR repeal with broader reforms to health care payment and delivery. Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D-PA) and Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) reintroduced their legislation on the topic, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://schwartz.house.gov/press-release/schwartz-and-heck-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-repeal-sgr-and-reform-medicare-1#.UYq4vqKR8y4"">Medicare Physician Payment Innovation Act</a>.&nbsp; President Obama’s FY 2014 budget, released last month, also embraced this approach. &nbsp;On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health held a hearing exploring&nbsp;<a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/sgr_joint_release_document.pdf"">a joint proposal</a>&nbsp;from the House Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Jack Lewin, MD, Chair of NCHC’s Board of Directors, the reservoir of support among stakeholders is growing.&nbsp; “This used to be&nbsp; just a doctors’ issue, but today, consumer advocates, physicians, hospitals, or purchasers and payers for care all agree we have to seize this chance to realign our reimbursement with superior clinical quality and lower costs.”</p>

211,"Stakeholder Coalition Urges Verma to Prioritize Advanced Payment Model Participation at Innovation Center","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, DC – In a letter sent Friday, the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) called on Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma to make broader participation in advanced payment models for physicians, nurses, and clinicians the central focus of the Innovation Center’s efforts to improve quality and curb costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Administrator Verma has the opportunity to move the needle on outcomes by taking&nbsp;the Innovation Center’s flagship payment&nbsp;initiatives to the next level, driving constructive innovation in Medicare Advantage, and listening to consumers and their advocates.&nbsp;NCHC is&nbsp;ready and willing to help move that effort forward,” said John Rother, NCHC’s President and CEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its submission, NCHC made several recommendations aimed at broadening clinicians’ opportunities to participate in the Advanced Alternative Payment Model track that was established by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Program Act of 2015 while maintaining those models’ standards.&nbsp;The recommendations were offered in response to an Innovation Center New Direction Request for Information (RFI) announced by CMS on September 20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCHC’s letter can be found below, and the detailed comments can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/"">here</a>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC&nbsp;is&nbsp;a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing more than 80 participating organizations, including medical societies, businesses, unions, health care providers, faith-based associations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, minorities,&nbsp;and persons with disabilities.&nbsp;The Coalition is committed to advancing - through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy – an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We deeply appreciate your decision to offer this Request for Information on the future of the CMS Innovation Center and the opportunity to offer our response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the middle of the last century, America’s health care costs have been driven upward by a fee-for-service reimbursement system that rewards quantity and complexity of services—not positive patient outcomes. Yet after two decades of bipartisan leadership across changes of Administration and Congressional control, federal policy has begun to pursue a more value-based path. In recent years, leading purchasers, plans, and providers, as well as forward-thinking state governments, have increasingly embraced innovative new models of health care delivery and payment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, NCHC’s provider, clinician, payer, and employer members are now reporting a slowing of value-based contracting, which they attribute to remaining uncertainty about the future of alternative payment models in the current policy environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, the manner and speed with which you employ the Innovation Center’s unique authorities is of particular importance. Actions taken and signals sent now could well determine whether the transition advances at a pace and scale sufficient to enhance affordability or whether most patients and clinicians remain mired in a costly fee-for-service reimbursement system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this reason, the National Coalition on Health Care is especially eager to work with you to maximize the Innovation Center’s impact. Our primary recommendation is that you make broadening opportunities for participation in robust Advanced Alternative Payment Models the central goal of the Innovation Center. Our detailed comments are appended, but the rest of our recommendations are summarized below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Continue to test and evolve the Innovation Center’s leading models in traditional Medicare. This requires expanding participation opportunities in proven population-based models as well as making the new voluntary bundled payment model available nationwide, on a voluntary basis, during the 2018 performance year. Additionally, to maximize impact on cost and quality, NCHC strongly supports providing advanced organizations the option of assuming full performance risk either for overall spending or primary care services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Pursue broader testing of innovative payment models in Medicare Part C. Specifically, we applaud CMS’ decision to grant credit for MA AAPM participation toward MACRA’s participation thresholds and urge CMS to swiftly implement the planned demonstration. Additionally, NCHC supports the testing of a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan (CBI-SNP) Model that uses targeted home- and community-based services to prevent institutional stays among Medicare-only beneficiaries.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Engage consumer and patient voices in the development and implementation of new models. Engagement of beneficiaries and their advocates is particularly important to the sustainability and impact of payment and delivery reform. As the Agency proceeds, we call for mechanisms to ensure beneficiaries and their advocates are involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of Innovation Center models.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By aligning federal policy with the most innovative private sector and state payment reform initiatives, your leadership and the work of the Innovation Center can substantially advance the movement toward value. We look forward to working with you toward that end. Please do not hesitate to contact me at&nbsp;jrother@nchc.org&nbsp;or NCHC’s Policy Director, Larry McNeely, at&nbsp;lmcneely@nchc.org.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six percent of seniors have used coupons to purchase brand name drugs even though Medicare has banned that tactic, according to a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/node/1210/"">survey</a>&nbsp;from the National Coalition on Health Care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As policymakers balance the books in Medicare, our research confirms that drug coupons are wasting Medicare and taxpayer dollars,” John Rother, CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, said in a statement. If the 6 percent of survey respondents is true of all Medicare recipients, NCHC estimates that 2 million Medicare beneficiaries are using coupons to buy drugs that end up costing the government more money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drug companies distribute the coupons to medical offices or via the internet. When buying brand-name prescription drugs, consumers redeem the coupons to reduce or eliminate higher co-pays.&nbsp;Giving coupons for brand-name drugs is legal in all state private insurance markets, except for Massachusetts, but is banned in Medicare and other federal programs.&nbsp;“Consumers might see lower costs for brand-name drugs, but their health plans still end up paying more to the brand-name manufacturer.&nbsp; That means higher costs for everyone,” Rother said.<br>The Congressional Budget Office says it costs Medicare $76 each time it pays for a more expensive brand-name drug when an affordable generic is available.</p>

<p><em>Statement by National Coalition on Health Care&nbsp;President and CEO John Rother on the announcement of a bipartisan deal to fund Cost-Sharing Reduction payments and expand states’ flexibility through Section 1332 waivers</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Alexander-Murray deal to stabilize the non-group health insurance markets is heartening news for Americans’ health care. No market, plan, provider, or family can long function with the level of uncertainty we’ve experienced over recent months. &nbsp;It’s long past time that a stabilization deal, as well as other key health funding measures, landed on President Trump’s desk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“After Finance Committee passage of the KIDS&nbsp;Act, full Senate passage of the CHRONIC Care Act, and today’s announcement, lawmakers increasingly have the elements of progress in hand.&nbsp; They have the capacity to forestall disruption to American families’ coverage and access and &nbsp;curb chronic care costs, even as we all prepare for a broader debate about how to make health care more affordable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But with millions of Americans choosing a health plan starting November 1, state CHIP budgets running out, and health center and medical training funding expired, Americans cannot wait much longer for this Congress to govern.”</p>

<p>The National Coalition on Health Care convened a group of leading stakeholders in February of 2021 to discuss the role that all payer claims databases (APCDs) can play in advancing health care affordability. Specifically, we wanted to understand the role that APCDs could play in driving purchaser leverage to reduce health care costs. Purchasers and policymakers need data that provide insights into cost drivers, and those associated with relatively better value and outcomes. Our discussion followed new short-term federal grant funding passed by Congress at the end of 2020 for state APCDs in Section 115 of the No Surprises Act, included in the Consolidated Omnibus Act, 2021.&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NCHC-Issue-Brief_All-Payer-Claims-Databases-FINAL-03.22.21.pdf"">Read the full issue brief here</a>.</p>

<p>When talking about wellness programs, seniors are often left out of the conversation. But many seniors are obese or engage in less physical activities as they age. It is no surprise then that the most frequently occurring conditions among seniors are linked to hypertension, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21323620"">Studies</a>&nbsp;have established the effectiveness of senior wellness programs that improve the overall health through increased physical activity, better nutrition, smoking cessation, and support of other healthy behaviors. They’ve demonstrated reduced inpatient admissions, health care costs, and improved health-related quality of life. With chronic disease and high health care expenditures plaguing our health care system, why not promote a large-scale senior wellness program through a program that directly cares for the group? A Medicare Wellness Program!</p>

<p>The American College of Physicians, the largest medical-specialty organization and second-largest physician group in the United States, has joined the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP), a broad-based coalition working for solutions to skyrocketing prescription medicine prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“ACP members work on the front lines of our health care delivery system and have witnessed firsthand the harm caused to patient health and personal finances by unsustainable pharmaceutical drug prices, especially those for new specialty drugs,” says John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, which leads CSRxP. “Exorbitant drug prices deny patients access to life-enhancing medicines and result in higher out-of-pocket costs, premiums, and taxes. To prevent our health care system from going bankrupt, we need to establish a drug pricing structure based on value and data-driven evidence and balance between the interests of innovative drug manufacturers and those of society and our health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The pricing of specialty drugs increasingly lacks transparency and rationality,” says ACP President David A. Fleming. “We’re seeing the introduction of many patent-protected drugs with monopolistic pricing power that fail to demonstrate a relationship between their price and their value to the health care system. Though many of these medications offer great promise, the price tag for health care clinicians and patients is simply too much to bear. We look forward to working with the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing to address these challenges.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2013 specialty drugs accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. prescriptions but for more than 25 percent of prescription spending. By the end of the decade, just 2 to 3 percent of all prescribed medications will be specialty drugs, but they will account for roughly 50 percent of the total drug spend, according to CVS Health.</p>

<p>Situated along the famous San Andreas fault in Northern California’s Bay Area, Gilead rattled the health care market this year by pricing its Hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi at $84,000. After months of unabated outrage from policymakers, consumer, employer, and patient organizations over the price of Sovaldi, Gilead has triggered an aftershock even more powerful than its initial shock with a new Hep C treatment priced at a staggering $94,500.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gilead has made clear that it&nbsp;values Wall Street above the interests of patients, the insured, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gilead justifies its pricing by pointing out that its new formulation is priced less than the previous combination of its old therapy with other treatments. However, this argument is a bit disingenuous because Sovaldi’s $84,000 price tag constituted the bulk of the former combo drug price. Moreover, Gilead admits that it prices it products based on the preceding product in the therapeutic area rather than on any calculation of value. That’s a dangerous and unsustainable practice that can only lead to one thing: ever increasing prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is that Sovaldi has helped start a national dialogue on how to sustain the biomedical innovation that is so important to our future. The bad news is that Gilead is severely testing the limits of this sustainability.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John Rother</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the sequester in place, some in Congress have embraced it, believing that these across-the-board cuts can actually help address our long-term fiscal problems. They are badly mistaken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Congress has not even begun to grapple with what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has called our greatest fiscal challenge: rising healthcare costs. In fact, the debate around the sequester has diverted attention from the more fundamental goals of “bending the curve” of rising per capita healthcare costs and getting more value for our public and private healthcare dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The need for further action to address these longer-term problems remains. Congress has three choices: continued, indiscriminate meat-ax cuts like the sequester; shifting of federal costs onto consumers, health plans or employers; or a smart savings approach that finally addresses the enormous levels of waste and inefficiency in our health system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meat-ax approach is the simplest to comprehend and implement. Congressional budgeters can pick any amount of savings they desire and simply lower the federal government’s payments to healthcare providers, drug plans, health plans, and state Medicaid programs accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sequester itself is exhibit A for this approach, trimming 2% from every payment Medicare makes to providers and plans. However, the sequester is not the only place you can find meat-ax cuts. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, created in 1998, was an ill-conceived attempt to apply this strategy to physician payment. Current proposals to block grant Medicaid would apply similar principles to that critical safety net program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undoubtedly, the meat-ax could make the federal balance sheet look better. But its consequences for the healthcare system on which we all depend are real. Indiscriminate cuts to hospitals could drive up the prices they charge businesses and health plans. Indiscriminate cuts to providers could hasten the retirement of a generation of physicians that we need badly if we are to reduce avoidable hospital admissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another path would trim the deficit by shifting costs now borne by the federal government onto consumers. In its most direct form, this means raising premiums for Medicare Part B physician services and increasing deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. Versions of premium support that ratchet down the federal government’s contribution to beneficiaries’ coverage over time also achieve budget savings by making beneficiaries pay more. Similarly, raising the age of Medicare eligibility shifts costs on to seniors and employers by requiring 65- and 66-year-olds to find and pay for their own coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scaling back Medicare coverage in this way could allow the federal government to dodge the costs created by retirement of a generation of baby boomers. For a time, even a decade or more, it could give the appearance of fiscal solvency. However, this strategy does nothing to tame growth in per capita healthcare costs, and, eventually, even these scaled-back programs will prove unsustainable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A smart savings approach, on the other hand, would attack the actual root causes of cost growth and inefficiency in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This path requires real policy change, not just a hack-and-slash budgetary exercise. It would move the bulk of providers out of our current fee-for-service system and into payment models that support high-quality, low-cost care. It would mean moving toward value-based benefits that help consumers manage their health and seek out the best care for their healthcare dollar. Finally, it would demand injecting transparency and competition into overpriced markets for hospital services and medical equipment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The core elements of this smart savings approach are not new. Experts on both sides of the aisle have known for years that we must either move to a higher-value health system or face painful cuts to provider reimbursement, health coverage, or both. The 50 specific recommendations detailed in the National Coalition on Health Care’s Plan for Health and Fiscal Policy, released in November 2012, can start us down the road of smart savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the sequester now in effect, there is real urgency to choose the best way forward. At stake are our hopes for short-term economic recovery and the long-term affordability of healthcare for our families, businesses, and public institutions. Should Congress fail to act, or should they make the wrong choice, the rest of us will end up paying the price.</p>

<h1>And Now a Word… About the Sequester</h1>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the sequester in place, some in Congress have embraced it, believing that these across-the-board cuts can actually help address our long-term fiscal problems. They are badly mistaken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Congress has not even begun to grapple with what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has called our greatest fiscal challenge: rising healthcare costs. In fact, the debate around the sequester has diverted attention from the more fundamental goals of “bending the curve” of rising per capita healthcare costs and getting more value for our public and private healthcare dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The need for further action to address these longer-term problems remains. Congress has three choices: continued, indiscriminate meat-ax cuts like the sequester; shifting of federal costs onto consumers, health plans or employers; or a smart savings approach that finally addresses the enormous levels of waste and inefficiency in our health system.</p>

<p><a>The Administration’s&nbsp;</a><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html"">continued pursuit</a>&nbsp;to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the courts openly undermines affordable health insurance coverage during the pandemic, threatening our public health response and economic recovery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented and widespread damage to our health and economy</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since January, more than 3 million people have been&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"">infected</a>&nbsp;with COVID-19 and at least 135,900 have died because of COVID-19 in the United States. &nbsp;As of June 2020, nearly 22 million Americans, or about 13 percent of the labor force, are&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"">receiving</a>&nbsp;unemployment benefits. In February, the U.S. unemployment rate&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/11/unemployment-rose-higher-in-three-months-of-covid-19-than-it-did-in-two-years-of-the-great-recession/"">hovered</a>&nbsp;around 3.8 percent, but the unemployment rate as of May was 13 percent. Nearly 23 million Americans may be&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/20-million-renters-are-at-risk-of-eviction/"">evicted</a>&nbsp;in the coming months as the result of this public health crisis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between February and May, a study&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.familiesusa.org/resources/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-resulting-economic-crash-have-caused-the-greatest-health-insurance-losses-in-american-history/"">estimated</a>&nbsp;that 5.4 million workers lost their health insurance as a result of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/coronavirus-health-insurance-trump.html"">weakened economy</a>.&nbsp;The Urban Institute&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2020/05/how-the-covid-19-recession-could-affect-health-insurance-coverage.html"">compiled</a>&nbsp;various scenarios, with the base scenario estimating that roughly 25 million people will eventually lose employer-sponsored coverage because of the pandemic.&nbsp; Without health insurance, people may face high medical costs if they become sick, which could exacerbate the current public health emergency and the underlying backlog of unmet health care needs. During the early stages of the pandemic, patients&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/health/coronavirus-insurance-healthcare.html"">avoided</a>&nbsp;seeing their primary care physicians because they feared catching COVID-19. Now, patients continue to delay medical care because of medical expenses (or both).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As individuals lose their employer’s health insurance, they may become newly eligible for additional options. Of those losing their employer-sponsored plan, the Urban Institute&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2020/05/how-the-covid-19-recession-could-affect-health-insurance-coverage.html"">estimated</a>&nbsp;that 47 percent would be eligible for Medicaid, 25 percent will get coverage through the state exchange or other private plans, and a remaining 29 percent will become uninsured. Most of these options are available to those who were already uninsured before the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>Major avenues for gaining affordable coverage for the uninsured&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Medicaid.&nbsp;</strong>Individuals may&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/coronavirus-updates/health-insurance-options-if-youve-lost-your-job"">seek</a>&nbsp;insurance through state Medicaid programs, especially in states that have expanded coverage beyond those categorically needy and to higher income levels. In states that have expanded Medicaid, it is estimated that approximately 23 percent of laid-off workers will be uninsured. However, in states that have not expanded Medicaid, approximately 43 percent of laid-off workers will be&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.familiesusa.org/resources/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-resulting-economic-crash-have-caused-the-greatest-health-insurance-losses-in-american-history/"">uninsured</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Private insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces.&nbsp;</strong>Individuals may seek private, individual insurance through state exchanges. The majority (&gt;80%) of enrollees in marketplace plans qualify for federal premium tax credit subsidies. The generosity of the premium tax credits varies and depends on an individual’s income. However, some workers may not qualify for subsidies, which could mean high premiums, coverage with high deductibles, or they are priced out of the market entirely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).&nbsp;</strong>For those who become unemployed but had employer-sponsored coverage, COBRA gives workers the option to continue coverage under their current plan. However, COBRA can be expensive – although an individual or family can keep their coverage, the employer is no longer subsidizing the monthly premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>These avenues for affordable coverage are under threat</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a>Amidst the pandemic, the Administration has openly undermined coverage options for the newly unemployed and those already uninsured by continuing their lawsuit against the ACA. &nbsp;</a>The Administration&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html"">asked</a>&nbsp;the Supreme Court to overturn the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: the law that provides for Medicaid expansion and ACA marketplace subsidies. Striking down the Affordable Care Act could&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2020/06/24/486768/health-care-repeal-lawsuit-strip-coverage-23-million-americans/"">lead</a>&nbsp;to upwards of 23.3 million more uninsured, in addition to those who have already lost their job-based coverage in the pandemic. The Administration has done<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-07-14/millions-lose-health-insurance-coverage-trump-little-help-coronavirus"">&nbsp;little</a>&nbsp;to bolster other safety net programs that could help. People without insurance are susceptible to high prices for COVID-19 treatment, in addition to high prices for everyday services and drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A massive spike in the number of uninsured Americans would deal a serious blow to the country’s economic recovery – which is already under intense pressure and uncertainty as we inch closer to the holiday and flu season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although Congress required tests and vaccines to be<a href=""https://nchc.org/static/5e583a2544d97f413cf8190e/t/5ee11eb68b24ba665bd9f2f1/1591811766958/VBID-in-COVID-response-1-pager-FINAL.pdf"">&nbsp;free</a>&nbsp;for both the insured and uninsured, and HHS has&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/04/27/hhs-launches-covid19-uninsured-program-portal.html"">provided</a>&nbsp;a means for providers to be reimbursed for treating the uninsured for COVID-19, high costs can still act as a harmful deterrent when people slip through cracks. There have been cases, for example, of people&nbsp;<a href=""https://khn.org/news/bill-of-the-month-covid19-tests-are-free-except-when-theyre-not/"">seeking testing</a>, but not actually receiving the test, and therefore facing high price bills. Congress nor the Administration has taken steps to cover the uninsured for the full scope of COVID treatment, such as those who need long-term care, nor protect patients from the full scope of surprise billing. These policies have a direct effect on our ability to contain the virus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4><strong>Immediate policy options for expanding coverage and supporting continuity &nbsp;</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a>As the number of new cases accelerates in the United States,&nbsp;</a><a href=""https://nchc.org/national-coalition-on-health-care-constructs-memo-on-phase-4-covid-19-house-proposal/"">action</a>&nbsp;could be taken to ensure that the uninsured, or those about to be uninsured, have access to quality health care. These are a minimum, not a comprehensive, set of options:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Incentivize non-expansion states to expand Medicaid by returning to 100% FMAP for states that expand now.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand eligibility for subsidies for marketplace coverage above 400% of the federal poverty level.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href=""https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/key-issues-related-to-cobra-subsidies/#:~:text=The%20American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment,offered%20by%20their%20former%20employer.&amp;text=Eligible%20individuals%20were%20required%20to,than%2035%25%20of%20COBRA%20premiums."">Provide subsidies</a>&nbsp;for COBRA benefits to ensure those who lose their job have immediate access to some kind of coverage.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increase health plan flexibility to delay coverage termination on the exchanges.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a federal Special Enrollment Period (SEP) through&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"">healthcare.gov</a></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These measures now will help health care affordability long-term: not only be reducing the uninsured, but preventing premium spikes or provider consolidation.</p>

<p>Former Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office Director Melanie Bella said if officials overhaul the Medicaid program, this move will greatly impact Medicare beneficiaries. Ms. Bella discussed an overhaul’s impact during a briefing that National Coalition on Health Care, a nonpartisan organization, hosted on April 10, 2017, according to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.beckersasc.com/https:/www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Medicare/64481?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2017-04-11&amp;eun=g948579d0r&amp;pos=3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>MedPage Today.</em></a></p>

<p>Here are six notes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Ms. Bella cited 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation data, saying almost 11 million Medicare beneficiaries also use Medicaid services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. As the Medicaid program currently operates, the federal government covers between 50 percent and 75 percent of Medicaid spending, based on a state’s per capita income relative to the national average. Thus, poorer states receive more funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. If officials implemented a per-capita cap on Medicaid spending, states would receive funding based on the number of enrollees multiplied by the state’s average cost per person during a pre-determined year. Then, officials would multiply this figure by a “trending factor.”</p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By many technical standards, American medicine is the best in the world. But it is plagued by serious and significant quality defects. These quality problems include overuse of treatments that on scientific grounds cannot benefit patients; misuse of services such as hospital treatment errors that harm patients; and underuse of treatments that would benefit patients. These problems exist in managed care and fee-for-service systems, across all health providers, in large and small communities and in all parts of the country. Scientific evidence favors the strong conclusion that improvements in American health care are both feasible and can contribute to substantial, double-digit reductions in the total costs of care. Even with modest assumptions about defect rates in health care, total cost reductions of nearly 30 percent below current levels should be attainable while improving the overall quality of care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opportunities for improvement of American health care are vast, and are closely linked to the social need for greater efficiency and value in health care. For many forms of defect, including overuse, error, and many forms of service failure, deficiencies in care lead to excess costs of care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stakes are high; in intensive care units, efforts to improve through reduction of waste and excess have yielded reductions in cost of 30 percent in a few months, without harming patients, and in many cases making patients safer and better off in the bargain. Over an eight-year period, Green Bay, Wisconsinís cesarean section rate fell by 30 percent to under 12 percent overall. If the current national C-section rate of over 24 percent could be moved half-way toward Green Bayís rate, there would be 250,000 fewer C-sections each year in the U.S., with decreased pain and surgical complications for mothers, shorter lengths of stay in hospitals, decreased subsequent repeat C-sections in later pregnancies, and probable financial savings of over $3000 per delivery, or a total of $750,000,000 nationally per year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading researchers on hospital errors recently published an estimate of $4000 per drug as the health care cost of recovery from its own damage. Scaled up the American health care system as a whole, it suggests savings of billions of dollars per year if we were to reduce only one form of error (medication error) by only 50 percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Millions of people do not receive care they need and suffer needless complications that add to health care costs and reduce productivity. The underuse of simple forms of antibiotics for simple infections and of effective forms of prevention such as pneumococcal vaccine in clinical practice or the use of bicycle helmets at the community level cause millions of dollars in care of the conditions that could have been prevented, but were not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of quality improvements, with the attendant cost reductions, are in hand, through the work of many practitioners and health care managers who have found a way to make these needed improvements in local settings. As of yet, however, these case-by-case improvements have not yet summed up to what is now needed in American health care: a breakthrough example of system-level performance of unprecedented quality at affordable cost. This is what Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers of automobiles did for American industry: alert them not just to the theoretic possibility but to the fact that quality improvement and marketplace success go hand in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obstacles stand in our way to quality improvement and replicating success stories. First is the fear of the truth. Health care leaders must not regard quality problems as sources of embarrassment or as indications of bad faith, but as opportunities for improvement. The second barrier is the problem of finding alternatives to the status quo. We need new models that can build confidence in the feasibility of improvement. The third barrier is that health care is missing a comprehensive example of breakthrough performance ó a model for all to emulate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is needed is a compilation of the very best practices and features, which are embodied in organized delivery systems that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use safety science techniques to drive error rates continually lower;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Practice and promote prevention seriously;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a seamless, timely delivery of care flow for all patients;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Involve patients and families fully in their own care and offer patients increasing control over decisions that affect them;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Break down the walls of intimidation and misunderstanding among professionals, patients and families;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Perform no scientifically groundless treatments; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Formally search for effective, proven care practices, and assure that patients benefit reliably from such appropriate care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent attention to creating a Patient Bill of Rights is welcome, and badly needed as a form of reassurance to a worried American public. But a Patient Bill of Rights is not nearly enough to address the overall need for improvement of health care nationwide. That need is broad, deep, and pervasive -- far beyond mere protection of rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time for American health care, through its leaders, to devote itself to achieving for the public the breakthroughs in performance ó defect reduction, patient safety, improvements in appropriateness, service enhancements, and waste reduction ó which will lead us at last to believe that Americans can have the care they deserve at a cost well within their means to afford. The plausibility of this accomplishment is no longer in question. Our nation urgently needs the most serious form of dedication to improvement, starting at the top of American health care organizations which is expected and demanded by the American public at large.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Itís a paradox. American medicine is the best in the world, but it is plagued by defects. A blue ribbon report this year from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences documents three types of serious problem in technical care: underuse, overuse, and misuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Underuse"" refers to the failure to offer patients diagnostic tests and treatments that are proven scientifically to improve their outcomes. As Professor Mark Chassin (Chair of the IOMís National Roundtable on Health Care Quality) puts it, ""...(U)nderuse of proven, effective interventions is ubiquitous in U.S. medicine."" Examples from the IOM report and elsewhere include the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simple, inexpensive medications, including aspirin and beta-blocker drugs, can significantly reduce the likelihood of dying from heart attacks. Yet one recent study of elderly heart attack victims showed that only one in five of the eligible patients was receiving the appropriate medications.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Inhaled steroid medications can prevent disability and complications in many asthmatic patients. Nationally published expert guidelines for the care of asthma now specify how these medicines should be used, and yet fewer than one-third of eligible asthma patients receive the correct treatment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy), combined with radio therapy, has been proven in well-designed randomized trials to be effective and safe treatment for most women with early- stage breast cancer, and yet evidence published in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care shows a 30-fold variation from hospital to hospital around the United States in the rate of use of this approach, compared with more radical, and scientifically unnecessary, surgery.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Depression is a common and treatable disorder, but primary care doctors fail to diagnose it, and therefore fail to treat it, in almost half of the victims of depression in their patient panels.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bicycle helmets save lives; they reduce the risk of head injury in bicycle accidents by 85% at a cost of under $20 per child. The city of Seattle, Washington, has dramatically reduced head injuries in children through a city-wide program that has raised childhood bicycle helmet use to over 60%. Yet nationally only 12% of children wear helmets when they ride.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Overuse"" involves subjecting patients to tests, procedures, and medications that, on scientific grounds, cannot help them, or, in the most egregious cases, are known to cause harm. Why overuse occurs is a matter of debate in the medical community, but its frequency is well-proven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Over 1,000,000 cesarean sections are performed in the United States each year ó almost 25% of all births are surgical. Using the best available scientific evidence, and drawing on the experience of countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, where cesarean section rates are less than one-third of the U.S. rate, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the World Health Organization have determined that cesarean section rates below 15% can be safely achieved. By this standard, over 400,000 cesarean sections in the U.S. each year are unnecessary.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Over the past 15 years, researchers from the RAND Corporation and elsewhere have conducted a series of well-designed studies of the appropriateness of various types of surgery and invasive diagnostic tests and found ""inappropriateness"" rates (not ""close calls,"" but frankly unnecessary procedures) with the following frequency, for example: 32% of carotid endarterectomies; 16% of hysterectomies; 17% of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies; and 17% of coronary angiograms. In a recent meta-analysis study conducted on behalf of the National Coalition on Health Care, RAND estimated that 30 percent of acute care is inappropriate.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Excessive use of powerful antibiotics is common, leading to extra costs, higher rates of toxic side-effects, and encouragement of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. One recent study in the Colorado Medicaid program of the treatment of 12,000 children with their first episodes of middle ear infection found that 30% of the children were treated with new, broad-spectrum, expensive, and potentially unsafe antibiotics despite national research and expert guidelines urging the use of simple, inexpensive antibiotics as far better initial treatment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spent over five years reviewing well over 6000 published research articles on the effectiveness of clinical preventive practices, such as screening tests, counseling, and immunizations. The Task Force found good evidence behind many forms of prevention, but it also found that many allegedly preventive practices, such as screening urinalyses in well populations, ultrasound tests in normal pregnancies, and screening electrocardiograms, had no scientific support and in some cases lead to harm from meddlesome and unnecessary followup procedures. And yet many of these wasteful practices remain in widespread use.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Well-designed, randomized studies of new-onset low back pain, the third or fourth most common complaint in all of ambulatory medical care, show that two days of bed rest produces just as much relief as a week or more; that early, supported return to work encourages healing; and that expensive diagnostic tests (like MRI scans) in the first few weeks of back pain almost never yield any useful information compared with ""watchful waiting"" for this usually self-limited problem. And yet physicians frequently prescribe long periods of bed rest, advise patients to remain out of work much longer than necessary, and order MRIís and other tests much earlier than they should.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Misuse"" is the term the IOM uses to refer to poorly executed tests and procedures ó mixups, errors, and flaws ó whether or not the test or procedure was appropriate in the first place. The American public has become familiar with egregious, tragic errors in care through newspaper headlines about a wrong leg amputated or a fatally high dose of a chemotherapy agent. Less familiar is the longstanding and large body of evidence health care researchers have accumulated on the prevalence of errors in care overall ó some lethal, but many more merely wasteful, inconvenient, or transiently disabling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Harvard Medical Practice Study of over 30,000 hospitalizations in New York State found serious complications from care, harming over 3 percent of patients, and placing many more at risk. Based on this study and others, the Harvard researchers estimated that 180,000 die each year as a result of adverse medical events. Two-thirds of these deaths, or 120,000 each year, are considered preventable. The Harvard team concluded that medical injuries and deaths due to errors constitute the nationís ""hidden epidemic.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Careful reviews in two outstanding teaching hospitals found serious or potentially serious medication errors in almost 7 patients for every 100 admissions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Understandably, given the source, the IOM panel focused on overuse, underuse, and misuse of technical medical care ó the devices, tests, drugs, and treatments that doctors use. Patients, families, and health care managers know that other categories of performance in health care suffer equally from high defect rates. These categories, including service, waiting times, access, and costs, are ""qualities"" of care, as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Waiting times in almost all health care settings are excessive, especially when compared to waits in other service industries. Emergency room patients other than the most seriously ill often wait hours to be seen, and can be held in the ER for even longer periods between the decision to admit them and their actual transportation to their hospital bed. Delays in start times for scheduled surgery in hospitals average an hour or more. Inpatients commonly report slow response times to their requests for pain medications.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Americans spend almost 40% more dollars per capita on health care than citizens of any other nation on earth, and yet the results of that investment are by no means the best in the world according to several important measures. For example, twenty-one nations in the world have a lower infant mortality rate than the U.S.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Forty-two million Americans (16%) lack health insurance at least some time during the year; and a male black baby born in the U.S. today has a life expectancy eight years shorter than a male white baby.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Operating inefficiencies occur in American health care systems that simply would not be tolerated in other industries. Clinics with long waiting lists close at 5 p.m., failing to meet the needs of working parents and others. Extremely costly diagnostic machines remain idle on evening and weekends, even while long waiting lists build up for their use in daytime hours. Sometimes, systems and schedules seem built more for the convenience of the clinicians than for the needs and desires of the patients and families who depend on them. More often, both clinicians and patients share a feeling of frustration and helplessness in the face of systems full of delays, fragmentation, and other obstacles.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The litany of health care quality problems invites negative reaction, both from patients and payers, who have reasons to feel let down, and from doctors and other caregivers, who feel accused and personally criticized, even though the vast majority of them are trying hard to do a good job and care deeply about their calling. The paradox of American health care goes deeper than the apparent combination of ""the best of care and the worst of care."" A reality check must lead any knowledgeable observer of care ó anyone who really knows what goes on inside the system ó to conclude that these flaws ó overuse, underuse, misuse, waste, and poor service ó continue to abound despite the hard work and best efforts of the people who work in the health care system. Good people....bad problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The negative reactions can become full-fledged rage and lead sometimes to misguided attempts at remedy. The theme of ""accountability"" is a strong one in America ó not just in health care, and accountability, without doubt, can focus energies and guide behavior. Accountability requires measurement, and health care has invested heavily, with good results, in its own capacity to measure the effects of its work. Indeed, our enormous progress in measurement of health care outcomes, patient satisfaction, functional status, and appropriateness of care is the very reason that we now know so much more about our quality problems than we ever did before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But herein lies a fallacy ó the fallacy that measurement alone will produce the improvements we need. Measurement can help, in such forms as published ""report cards"" on the quality of care, or extensive accreditation and inspection procedures, such as the surveillance of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations or the National Committee on Quality Assurance. But measurement and public accountability for the quality of care are ineffective ó indeed, they are wasteful and merely induce games and bad feeling ó unless they are linked to changes in care itself. Measuring my time in the 400-yard dash may help motivate me to do better (especially if I have asked for the information), but it does not make me able to run the slightest bit faster. To run faster, I need to change the way I run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many in health care lack conviction that they can run any faster in the future than they do today. They feel helpless to improve; and they grow angry at patients, communities, and payers who continue to expect better care. Often loyal to their own doctors and hospitals, patients and communities look elsewhere to fix blame. They have come to believe that the problems come from outsiders ó those who do not give care ó avaricious insurance companies, venal managed care organizations, or bureaucratic governments. ""If only they left the doctors alone,"" they conclude, ""the care would get better."" The doctors and hospitals agree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But they are all wrong. Insurance companies and straight-jacket managed care systems can aggravate the problems, of course, but the way out for health care ó the route to what the American public ought to have in health care quality, safety, reliability, service, and efficiency ó cannot be found merely by peeling layers of inspection and cost-containment off the backs of caregivers. Improvement will not come from defense of any status quo; it will come from aspiration and bold changes in the ways that we give care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do we know that? Because it has been done. For every single problem listed in the IOMís long review of deficiencies in care, and for every defect in service, cost, waste, and access that health care researchers and critics have documented, we now have strong, compelling, often inspirational examples of what ""better"" looks like. Excessive cesarean section rates are common, but they are not universal. Many physicians overuse expensive antibiotics, but some do not. Waiting times are long almost everywhere in health care, but there are clinics and physician office practices that have driven waits nearly to zero. Most American children ride their bicycles without helmets, but not in Seattle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time to learn from success, even while we face the reality of our quality problems directly. Three primary barriers stand in our way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First: fear of the truth. So long as health care leaders and the patients and communities they serve regard quality problems primarily as sources of embarrassment and as indications of bad faith and carelessness, the patients will accuse and the caregivers will defend themselves. That is only human. All improvement begins with the intention to improve ó with the whole-hearted admission that a gap exists between what is and what should be. But, identifying a gap does not necessarily require fixing blame. It is equally possible to admit a need to improve, without blame, and then to begin the never-ending process of learning how to do things better. We do that every day in our schools, our hobbies, and our daily lives. The ""quality improvement"" slogan goes: Every defect is a treasure. Health care is loaded with treasures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second barrier ó once we overcome the fear of the truth ó is the problem of finding plausible alternatives to the status quo, examples that can build confidence in the feasibility of improvement and that give us ideas for approaching tasks differently. Better ways. Best practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third barrier is more subtle: health care is missing a comprehensive example of breakthrough performance ó a model for all to emulate. Even though, case-by-case, problem-by-problem, excellent examples exist of success by health care providers for almost every quality problem we have, no one ó no one at all ó in health care has ever yet ""put it all together."" It was different in automobile manufacturing. When Detroit began to awake in the mid-1970s to the global competitive threat, American automobile manufacturers had no difficulty developing a comprehensive image of the overall quality they lacked. They could buy the evidence on how good a car could be; it was called a Toyota. The performance of the Japanese automobile ó the whole automobile, in almost all dimensions of performance ó was so far superior to the American automobile that the need for global change could not be ignored. The Japanese gave American automobile manufacturers a ""two-fer"" ó both a threat to survival and a vision of what was possible ó both a wake-up call and breakfast. Perhaps the former, alone, would not have been enough.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additional barriers to fundamental improvement are structured into the habits and environment of health care. The financing system often rewards fragmented, non-cooperative behaviors, instead of fostering reduced redundancy, complexity, and interruptions of the entire care experience from the patientís viewpoint. A test done in a hospital is repeated unnecessarily in the nursing home, and then repeated again upon rehospitalization. A medical center opens a new cardiac surgery unit in already-oversupplied region. Lay health care executives, by tradition and training, often leave improvement of care vaguely up to physician staffs, rather than assuming full, corporate responsibility for improving overall performance. It is as if airline executives left airline safety up to pilots, rather than assuming primary responsibility for running a safe system. Health care also lacks well-developed infrastructures for transfer of best practices. The widespread adoption of sound system changes and programs is left to weak methods, like publication, rather than strong, carefully managed methods of deployment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Too bad for health care. The wake-up call may be here, in the form of a disillusioned and angry public and a demoralized and dispirited work force. But, so far, health care has no Toyota to tell us all what we could have if we change enough. If we are to overcome the third barrier ó to develop a vision of a new whole for American health care, functioning systemically at a total level never before seen ó we will have to use some imagination. From the patches of excellence that can teach us how we might overcome piecemeal the hundreds of quality defects that plague us, we will have to make a quilt ourselves to understand just how good it could get for all of us: patients, families, communities, payers, and those who give and manage health care in America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Letís examine some cases of leading organizations and people in health care for whom the status quo was not good enough, leaders who identified performance gaps, and then closed them. Their stories, and their successes, give us a glimpse of how much better American health care could get if these became, not the exception to the status quo, but the rule.</p>

<p>REDUCING OVERUSE OF CESAREAN SECTIONS IN GREEN BAY</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have seen above how prevalent overuse is in America, including overuse of highly invasive forms of care. Cesarean section rates are one dramatic case in point. Between 1970 and 1998, the American cesarean section rate rose from 5% of all births to nearly 25%. Few experts believe, and none have sound data, that American mothers or infants are on the whole better off because of this change. The occasional reports of complications from delayed cesarean section, such as uterine rupture or fetal distress, make more headlines than the much more common, but harder-to-assess complications ó pain, anaesthesia risks, post-operative infections, and blood loss, for example ó from hundreds of thousands of cesarean sections that simply did not need to be done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obstetricians and others offer lots of explanations for the climbing C-section rates, including the threat of malpractice suits, reimbursement systems that pay more for a C-section than for a normal delivery, the demands of patients who want to avoid labor, and the demands of doctors and hospital staff who want to complete their work at convenient times of the day. But, despite the explanations, none, or almost none, of the experts believe that the American C-section rate is anything near appropriate in medical terms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obstetricians in Green Bay, Wisconsin, set a goal of reducing C-section rates by 25%, while maintaining or improving maternal and infant outcomes. In 1986, the average C-section rate across all obstetricians in Green Bay was 16.3%, but rates varied widely from doctor to doctor. For example, in treating nulliparous patients (those having their first childbirth), the obstetrician-specific cesarean section rate varied from 4.3% to 12.3%. No differences were found in outcomes for mothers or infants, but doctors differed dramatically in their approaches to managing labor. For example, obstetricians with lower rates of cesarean section avoided inductions of labor, augmented labor with oxytocin only after the cervix was beginning to dilate, used oxytocin for longer periods and at higher doses, permitted longer second stages of labor without intervention, and used therapeutic rest for women with slow progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Robert DeMott, an obstetrician, became a community leader in developing approaches to safe reductions in cesarean rates, and helped to share information on practices and results with all of the obstetricians in the community. Over an eight-year period, Green Bayís cesarean section rate fell by 30% (to under 12% overall), while the national cesarean rate continued to rise to over 24%. In Dr. DeMottís own practice, the rate is 6.1%, and the rate in vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC rate) is 60%. (The national VBAC rate, by contrast, is well under 30%.) In 1995, Green Bayís cesarean section rate was 11.1%, with excellent maternal and infant outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the current national cesarean section rate of over 24% could be moved half-way toward Green Bayís rate, there would be 250,000 fewer cesarean sections each year in the U.S., with decreased pain and surgical complications for mothers, shorter lengths of stay in hospitals, decreased subsequent repeat cesarean sections in later pregnancies, and probable financial savings of over $3000 per delivery, or a total of $750,000,000 nationally.</p>

<p>REDUCING COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intensive care units are high-risk and high-cost environments in which mistakes and delays can have tragic and wasteful consequences. Conversely, improvements in ICU effectiveness and efficiency can produce immediate and dramatic gains for patients and caregivers. Traditional ICU improvements come in technological packages ó new drugs, devices, and procedures. These help, but greater leverage lies in redesign of ICU practices as a whole ó systemic improvements that require better teamwork, better flow of information, and a focus, not on snazzy bells and whistles, but on meeting the real needs of patients and families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Nash Health Systems in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, unnecessary ICU days for patients whose illnesses do not require intensive care have been reduced by over 90%. This means less disorientation for patients, less intimidation and anxiety for families, and much more efficient use of one of the hospitalís most expensive resources. When Nash started its work, over 40% of ICU beds at any given time were being occupied by patients who could have received care just as well outside the ICU. A clogged ICU system ó with two out of every five ICU days wasted ó is characteristic of the majority of American hospitals, and yet Nash solved the problem within a few months. Length of stay for patients on respirators in Nashís ICU has fallen by over 50%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drug costs continue to skyrocket in all areas of medical care, but especially so in ICUs. Wasteful, scientifically unnecessary sedatives account for a surprisingly large portion of the new, higher cost drugs, and ICU experts around the nation strongly advise that many older, less expensive medications are often wiser choices. Taking this seriously, the ICU team at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, in Albany, Georgia, adopted strong, scientifically grounded protocols for sedation and other forms of medication use, and, through these and other changes, reduced the cost of an average ICU day by over 20% in less than three months, without harming a single patient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Phoebe Putney Hospitalís carefully documented achievement of more than 20% reduction in ICU cost is fully within the reach of any ICU that today operates at an average level of efficiency, and Dr. William Brock, head of Phoebe Putneyís ICU, believes that they may have only scratched the surface of safe, prudent, improvements in efficiency. Dr. Terry Clemmer, Director of Critical Care Services at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, agrees. In cooperation with nurses and specialists there, his unit has reduced unnecessary ICU expenses by over $2 million per year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With similar commitment, inpatient physicians and nurses at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida totaled up the cost of their use of an intravenous fluid, albumen suspension, which has been shown in sound research to have almost no advantage over far cheaper and more available electrolyte solutions. To their surprise, they found an albumen bill of over $217,000 per year. They stopped it, achieving a 93% reduction in the use of the useless solution in a little over three months, saving the hospital over $202,000 per year that year and every year thereafter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These local gains of intensive care units are striking, and they grapple directly with forms of overuse of ineffective care and underuse of effective care, as classified by the IOM. Even more striking, however, is the failure of these successes to spread quickly and deliberately throughout the health care system, even when it comes to the relatively well-circumscribed multi-hospital systems of which these leaders are a part. For health care, it has proven very difficult indeed to make the best known practice, like St. Maryís ventilator management described below or Sarasotaís switch away from albumen, the standard (or the default) practice. Having discovered these nuggets of gold in the health care riverbed, we seem almost never to begin panning for the rest. Instead, health care organizations preserve the status quo as the default, favoring the familiar present over the best possible future.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FOCUSING ON PATIENTSí NEEDS, REDUCING COSTS, AND IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN CARDIAC SURGERY</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cardiac surgery is costly, risky, and anxiety-provoking for patients and their loved ones. Because the stakes are so high, improvements in cardiac surgery can have enormous payoffs, as progressive cardiac care departments, focused on breakthroughs, have found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked what they disliked most about their experiences of care, patients recovering from heart surgery commonly mention the pain and restriction caused by the various ""tubes"" that penetrate their bodies in the post-operative period ó mainly the endotracheal tubes in their windpipes, through which respirators help them breathe, and the chest drainage tubes that keep their injured lungs expanded and allow internal bleeding to be monitored and relieved. On average, an American patient who undergoes a successful, uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft operation will spend about 18 hours on a respirator machine post-operatively before his or her endotracheal tube is removed ó 18 hours of high risk, high cost, and, often, significant discomfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But not at St. Maryís Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. There, a cross-functional team of doctors, nurses, and others systematically have reduced post-operative ventilator time to a median of six hours, and an increasing percentage of their patients are having their respirator tubes removed safely and routinely immediately after their surgery ends. They spend no time at all on a respirator machine post-operatively. At Sentara Norfolk Hospital in Virginia, a similar cardiac surgery team has also reduced ventilator time post-operatively to under six hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The implications are profound, and they echo both in cost and in outcomes. By shortening post-operative ventilator time, Sentara Norfolk Hospital helped achieve reductions in total length of stay, since time on a respirator delays rehabilitation, requires the use of disabling sedatives, and introduces risks of complications such as ventilator-induced pneumonia and lung collapse (pneumothorax), which themselves may require prolonged treatment. (It is no accident that Nash Health System has reduced ventilator-induced pneumonia cases nearly to zero. That is in part a side-effect of their work on early, appropriate extubation.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Loma Linda University Medical Center in California, cardiac surgeon Steve Gundry leads a unit, characterized by innovation and a constant search for waste, which today can do safe and effective coronary artery bypass surgery for an average of $8000 per case, compared to the national average cost of $18,000 per case. Rochester (New York) General Hospitalís cardiac surgery unit, led by Dr. Ron Kirschner, has developed approaches to multidisciplinary teamwork and continuous flow processes that allows it to use its own operating rooms with nearly three times the efficiency of the average cardiac surgery unit, thereby conserving resources and improving the experience of patients at the same time. In addition, Rochester Generalís readmission rate for heart surgery patients (a measure of safe discharge) fell 50% in one year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Responsibly pursued, these enormous savings in cost and waste are not accomplished at the expense of safety or patient service. Indeed, usually the opposite is true. Inefficiencies lead to dangerous and inconvenient waits for patients and families. Patients extubated in six hours have much less discomfort than those extubated in 18 hours. Older, familiar sedatives have proven track records and are often less risky and easier to handle than the latest fad drug. Safely shortened lengths of stay get patients home sooner to familiar, healing environments, and reduce their exposure to the resistant bacteria and medication errors that lie within the hospitalís walls. As its efficiency has improved through better management of its surgery processes, Rochester General Hospitalís use of blood products in cardiac surgery has been cut in half, and its readmission rate (one measure of outcomes) has fallen 50%. The hazards of cost-containment, that the public justifiably fears at the hands of blunt, sometime blind, insurance rules and managed care policies, come from lack of wisdom or information, not from lack of opportunity. Safer, more effective, less expensive care is feasible, as the pioneers are proving, but only by basing changes on sound knowledge and clearly documented best practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The total magnitude of achievable gain in both outcomes and efficiency in acute, inpatient settings is still a matter for speculation, at least until some health care Toyota manages to ""put it all together."" But, experience such as that at Phoebe Putney, Sentara, Loma Linda, and Rochester General Hospital suggests that, overall, cost reductions of at least 30% in intensive inpatient settings, such as surgical units and ICUs, ought to be achievable through appropriate changes in care, while maintaining, and often improving, the experience and outcomes of patients and their loved ones.</p>

<p>REDUCING UNDERUSE OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR ASTHMA</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Underuse of effective care is as costly in human terms, and may be as costly in long-run financial terms, as are overuse and errors. Medical science now knows, for example, highly effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of attacks in asthma patients. Proper use of safe and effective inhaled steroid medications, coupled with ongoing patient education and self-monitoring of patientsí breathing capacities, can cut asthma complication rates dramatically. One HMO-based study showed an 80% decrease in hospital days and emergency room visits for asthma care among patients trained to avoid asthma triggers, measure their own lung function, follow a consistent treatment plan, and make adjustments in their own medications at home. Similar approaches at Yale-New Haven Hospitalís Primary Care Center led to a 50% decrease in hospital admissions and emergency department visits for high-risk asthma patients. A demonstration project involving American Health Care Network and physicians in Kokomo, Indiana, reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations for 350 asthmatics by over 95%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These improvements did not depend on generating new scientific data; the science was already in hand and fully codified and published by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The organizations that broke thorough to new performance levels simply put the science to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asthma is one of the most common reasons for visits to primary care doctors and causes more hospitalization among children than any other medical condition. Making the best-known programs of asthma care the standard for all asthmatic children would cut pediatric visits and hospitalizations dramatically.</p>

<p>REDUCING MEDICAL ERRORS AND IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IOMís third category of quality problem ó ""misuse"" or errors in care ó is as ripe for improvement as are overuse and underuse. The principles for improvement here come, in part, not from health care but from other industries where risk-reduction, error prevention, and recovery from errors have long been objects of concerted research and action. The hub of modern American scientific research on aeronautics, the NASA-Ames Research Laboratories near Palo Alto, California, has entire divisions devoted to the sciences that underlie the discovery, prevention, and mitigation of error and the improvement of safety. Todayís airplanes and space vehicles draw upon an immense library of theory, experiment, and experience in safety improvement, using principles from human factors engineering, operations research, statistics, and human and organizational psychology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care has no NASA-Ames to improve its safety, having relied primarily, instead, on traditional, but intellectually almost bankrupt, notions of personal accountability, blame, and exhortation to seek safety. In aviation, pilots involved in ""near miss"" hazards are strongly supported to report the problem and are welcomed to become involved in uncovering causes and inventing solutions for the future. In health care, nurses involved in ""incidents"" know that they will probably have a black-mark report end up in their personnel file, and, in the worst cases, may be roasted by internal committees or outside regulators. Therefore, no surprise, most health care ""near misses"" never get reported at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But some hospitals and health systems have mustered the courage and the curiosity to tackle hazards they way they ought to be tackled ó not with blame, but with study and principled redesign. At Fairview Health System in Minneapolis, a team of pharmacists, physicians, and others have capitalized on two major principles of human factors engineering ó standardization and simplification ó to reduce several types of serious medication errors by over 60%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do simplification and standardization help? Letís examine one specific case: errors in heparin dosage. Of all drugs in inpatient care, one of the most hazardous is the anticoagulant, heparin, used for patients who have thrombophlebitis or atrial fibrillation, for example, and need prompt anticoagulation. Heparin comes in five concentrations such as: 1000 units per cubic centimeter (cc), 5000 units per cc, and 10,000 units per cc. Many hospitals stock multiple concentrations in their pharmacies or nursing units. By far the most common form of heparin error (causing either undercoagulation or, worse, bleeding due to too much heparin) is a wrong dose, caused by use of the wrong concentration. A nurse means to administer one cubic centimeter of the 1000 units per cc heparin, but accidentally picks up a 10,000 units per cc vial. One way to prevent such an error is to exhort nurses to be more careful, but no modern student of error would bet much on that solution. To err is human. The better way ó the scientific way ó is to standardize the system to make it error-proof. In simple terms: stock only one form of heparin (say, the 5000 unit per cc form), and throw away the rest. Poof ó no mixups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is safety science at work. Unfortunately, even the simpler forms of modern approaches to system safety are virtually absent from health care organizations. The remedies are clear, but unused, and so patients live (or die) with rates of serious drug errors of 7 per 100 admissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past 30 years, air travel has become safer, measured in fatalities per passenger mile flown, by a factor of 20. Between 1950 and 1990, US airline fatalities in deaths per one million departures fell from 1.18 to 0.27, almost an 80% reduction, despite an enormous increase in the volume of air travel. Aviation safety has improved; safety in health care has not. And yet, if health care systems set about to become much safer, and harnessed the many sciences of safety to its service, order-of-magnitude improvements should be accessible, as they have been at Fairview. Using computer-assisted decision support, doctors at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City reduced adverse drug events ó complications ó from antibiotics in hospitalized patients by 30%, while at the same time reducing the average antibiotic cost per treated patient from $123 to $52. Financial benefit should accrue along with the improvement of outcomes. Automated, computerized reminder systems at the Reigenstrief Institute in Indianapolis and at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound in Seattle have vastly increased the reliability of appropriate followup of abnormal laboratory tests and use of effective preventive practices, like immunizations in the elderly. Leading researchers on health care error from the Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham and Womenís Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital recently published an estimate of $4000 per drug error as the health care cost of recovery from its own damage. Scaled up to the American health care system as a whole, this suggests savings of billions of dollars per year if we were to reduce only one form of error (medication error) by only 50%.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IMPROVING SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS IN HEALTH CARE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking primarily a technical view of quality of care, the IOM Roundtable group did not include service characteristics ó such as convenience, dignity, ease of access, privacy, communication, comfort, patient involvement in decision-making, and promptness of care, for example ó in its summary of quality levels. Had it done so, the IOMís report on defects would have been even more expansive and disturbing, for the service levels of much of health care would frankly be an embarrassment in any other human service industry. Long waits, anonymity, isolation, embarrassment, confusion, non-response, physical discomfort, and infantilization are all common characteristics of health care settings from patientsí and familiesí point of view, excused and permitted socially perhaps only because of durable and justified trust in the underlying samaritanism, skill, and professionalism of the people who work in those service-poor systems. In fact, patients more often sympathize with and excuse the doctors and nurses than blame them or complain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It does not have to be that way. ""Service"" in all of the dimensions mentioned, and others, is a legitimate and important ""quality"" of health care, and, even more to the point, many dimensions of good service are empirically associated with better care outcomes in the ""important"" dimensions of health status, physical function, pain control, and even longevity. The Picker Institute, housed at Harvard Medical School, has carefully documented patient reports on their own care and has developed easy-to-administer and internationally normed questionnaires that can allow any health care organization to know precisely how it is doing in these dimensions of care (as the Picker Institute puts it) ""through the patientís eyes.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of breakthroughs in service performance are just as much in hand in health care as are technical advances in clinical care. Almost 20 years ago, for example, innovators in California developed the so-called ""Planetree"" patient care units, now established in several dozen hospitals throughout the United States. Planetree Units fully incorporate the philosophy of patient-centered care, and they seek every possible way to offer patients and their families control over and participation in their own care. If they wish, Planetree inpatients can dress in their street clothes, not hospital ""johnnies""; they can read and write in their own medical records to increase communication between them and their caregivers; they administer their own medications in many cases, instead of waiting like children to have nurses give them pills from bottles that they could open just as well. Planetree Units have no ""visiting hours,"" since family members and loved ones are not ""visitors"" they are full partners in care, welcome all of the time; and the units have kitchens and snack bars in which patients and families can, if they wish, prepare their own meals when and how they choose to. One Planetree Unit now operates for cardiology patients at New Yorkís Mount Sinai Medical Center where families are trained to participate in care, including cardiac resuscitations. Ten minutes into a presentation by or a visit to a Planetree Unit, most observers, and most visiting doctors and nurses, ask the same question: ""Why isnít it like this everywhere?"" The answer is not ""because it costs too much."" Planetree Units operate with the same or lower staff-to-patient ratios as classical hospital wards. These service-oriented care systems are not more expensive than usual care; they are less expensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the most promising innovations in health care service today are methods to involve patients directly in their own technical care. Dr. Larry Staker, at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, has trained diabetic patients to monitor their own blood sugar levels and adjust their own insulin doses without Dr. Stakerís intervention, producing better blood sugar control, more satisfaction among patients, and lower costs of care. Innovators in asthma care in Kaiser-Permanente and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care system have taught asthmatic patients to measure their own lung function, adjust their own medications, and administer at home to themselves treatments formerly available only in hospitals. The result: symptoms and complications rates fall, satisfaction improves, and costs fall. Dr. Richard Rockefeller, of the Health Commons Institute, and colleague physicians, like Dr. Charles Burger, of Bangor, Maine, are using computerized patient record systems and other forms of decision support to help patients participate more as equals in their own care. In health care as a whole, the era of patient control, self-care, and truly shared decision making is only dawning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The waiting and delay so familiar to all in health care, both patients and providers, are not inevitable. Relatively simple changes in scheduling and information exchange, engineered by Dr. Mark Murray and Nurse Catherine Tantau at Kaiser-Permanenteís Rosemont Medical Center, have produced ""same-day access"" and nearly wait-free patient flow for ill patients, have reduced delays for routine appointments from over two months to one day, and done so without any expansion in staff at all. A team at Sewickley Valley Hospital in Pennsylvania reduced delays in start times for surgery (a chronic, costly, and annoying problem for surgeons, operating room staffs, patients, and their pacing families) in less than three months from an average of 80 minutes to less than 10 minutes, again with no changes in staffing. And the Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Unit at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, cut waiting times for routine appointments from an average of over 30 days to less than five days. What each of these ""delay-reducers"" did was to apply in health care some simple rules and methods for profiling demand, scheduling services, and streamlining procedures ó rules and methods that have been standard in many service industries other than health care for decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, for most of health care, the innovations developed (and published) by Dr. Murray, Sewickley Valley Hospital, and Mayo Clinic remain poorly deployed ó copied almost nowhere. The average clinical scheduling system operates with theories 30 years or more old, rather than with modern and better understandings of how to decrease or abolish waiting. Evidence from the best suggests that waiting time reductions of over 50% from the current averages should be relatively easy to achieve within current resource constraints, and that truly ""world class"" designs in clinics, offices, operating rooms, and emergency departments might reduce many chronic waits by 80% or more without raising costs a penny.</p>

<p>ADDING IT UP: HOW GOOD COULD HEALTH CARE GET?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what does this all add up to: a quilt, or just a mess? At the moment, itís the latter. The good news is that health care in America contains a treasure trove of gem-like breakthroughs in performance. For almost every example of poor quality ó overuse, underuse, and misuse ó that the IOMís Roundtable laments, a search uncovers an example of one or more practitioner or clinic that has buckled down, made scientifically grounded changes, and knocked the socks off the problem. Broaden the search to international terrain, and the likelihood of finding a thrilling counter-example approaches certainty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bad news is that the treasure-trove is undeveloped by those, especially leaders, who ought to be using that wealth to build a future. Not only do the particles of excellence lie lonely, unduplicated, not spread, but not even one organization has yet had the ability, or perhaps the courage, to collect these many, exciting innovations into a new whole ó a care system consisting throughout of the very best known and thereby performing at levels of quality, service, and low cost so far unimagined in the</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>mainstream of American health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How good could it get? Imagine that someone ó maybe even a smart investor ó convened the leading-edge innovators in improvement along all of the lines covered in the IOMís review, and added in innovations in the service dimensions of quality as well and found a way to link them in a common system of care operating everywhere at the ""best known"" or ""best currently achievable"" performance level. Such an organization in modern jargon might be called an ""Integrated Delivery System"" (IDS), putting under one managerial umbrella, in just the right proportions, hospitals, outpatient offices, specialty referral centers, nursing homes, home care, and all of the other major components of care needed to serve a population. But, unlike the run-of-the-mill IDS of today, which assembles average performers to create, at best, an average whole, this IDS would be a compilation of the best:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It performs no scientifically groundless surgery and administers no scientifically groundless medications (following examples like Dr. Bill Brock at Phoebe Putney and the team at Sarasota). In its commitment to evidence-based care, it eschews both wasted costs and avoidable hazards.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It formally searches for effective, proven care practices and assures that patients benefit reliably from such appropriate care. With 100% reliability, patients at this organization receive the influenza immunizations they need, get beta-blockers and aspirin at appropriate phases in care of their heart disease, and follow well-proven guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of asthma (as in the Yale Emergency Department and Kokomo, Indiana, projects). The medical record system supports the selection of the right antibiotics (as at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City) and acts as a ""tickler"" system when patients who could benefit from a preventive treatment fail to receive it (as in the Reigenstrief Institute in Indianapolis and parts of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>It is the safest health care organization ever known in the modern, technical era of health care. It uses simplification, standardization, and safety sciences such as human factors engineering to drive error rates continually lower and to mitigate the effects of the errors that do occur (as the team at Fairview did), and it systematically reduces its use of risky, invasive forms of care by developing and spreading safer, equally effective alternatives (following the example of the early extubation projects at St. Maryís Hospital, Sentara, and Loma Linda). The frequency of medication errors is not 7 per 100 admissions as in most American hospitals, but 1 per 1000 admissions, and headed lower.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It does not always wait for trouble. This organization takes prevention seriously, and follows where the evidence leads. It has built on Seattleís experience to drive bicycle helmet use to 90% in children and has followed the example of a Oklahoma City experiment on smoke detector use to reduce burn injuries in its patients by over 50%.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is free of waiting (as Kaiserís Dr. Mark Murray and Rochester General Hospitalís Dr. Ron Kirschner could help design it). All patients and staff experience smooth and seamless flow through the various parts of the system, not rushed, but stopping only when they wish to, and otherwise knowing that the health care system fully respects their time.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It involves patients and families fully in their own care, giving them control over decisions (as Dr. Jack Wennberg has designed) and teaching them to diagnose and treat themselves safely, if they wish (as Dr. Larry Staker does for diabetes patients and Kaiser Permanenteís Dr. Guillermo Mendoza and the Harvard Pilgrimís Health Care Plan Asthma Program do for asthmatics), achieving better outcomes, more satisfaction, and generally lower costs. Women with familiar symptoms of urinary tract infection diagnose and treat themselves safely, with out wasteful visits or delays (as they do at Dartmouthís Hitchcock Clinic). Computerized patient record systems and other forms of decision support have converted patients and doctors from passive-active models into teams of joint problem-solvers (as in the medical practices of Dr. Charles Burger and Dr. Richard Rockefeller).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is an open health care organization, breaking down the walls of intimidation and misunderstanding among professionals, patients, and families. Families, especially, are welcomed as respected participants and full partners, continually oriented, and involved, if they wish, in the care of their loved ones (as demonstrated by Dr. Terry Clemmer in his ICU and by the Planetree Units throughout the country). Patients read and write in their own medical records, improving communication, accuracy, and the patientsí knowledge of their own illnesses. There are no ""visiting hours"" here; patients and their loved ones are together whenever, and for as long as, they please.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It does not yet exist, but this organization need not remain a dream. All its elements of excellence, and many more, exist either in reality somewhere already, or are firmly supported by sound, scientific evidence. The aggregate can be an American health care organization that operates at a total cost per capita 30% lower than that spent on the average Americanís health care today; with health status outcomes for specific acute and chronic illness at or above the very best known profile of outcomes; trimmed of hazardous, costly excess and waste in ineffective medical procedures, drugs, diagnostic tests, supplies, and equipment; reinvesting those savings in forms of care, service, and prevention currently unaffordable; involving patients and families totally in their own care, with the fullest possible control (to the extent they want it) over the decisions and circumstances under which they receive that care; characterized by levels of service, smooth flow, dignity, responsiveness, clarity, and optimism that we today associate only with world-class service organizations; and 100 times safer than the health care of today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blue sky? Not at all. This performance is within reach, if we believe it, study it, and demand it, and if we are willing to change far enough and fast enough.</p>

<p>Today we released a fact sheet,&nbsp;<em>Care Coordination for High-Cost, High-Need Beneficiaries,</em>&nbsp;the third in our fact sheet series spotlighting challenges facing the U.S. health system and&nbsp;offering our recommendations for improving the quality and affordability of health care. The fact sheet can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/care-coordination-fact-sheet.pdf"">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Care Coordination for High-Cost, High-Need Beneficiaries&nbsp;</em>describes the difficulties confronting those Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who have the highest needs and generate the highest costs.&nbsp; It also identifies key policy opportunities to improve care for these patients.&nbsp; These include integrating behavioral health and primary care services, promoting patient-centered care planning, and improving chronic care and care coordination in Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Accountable Care Organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does this have to do with affordability?&nbsp; Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions accounted for 93 percent of total Medicare spending, and 98 percent of Medicare hospital readmissions in 2010. In addition, the average per capita Medicare spending for beneficiaries with one or more chronic conditions and one or more functional limitations (limitations that require help with activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing and dressing) was nearly twice that as average per capita spending for beneficiaries with three or more chronic conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Medicare beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions, spending is even higher.&nbsp; In 2010, Medicare spent an average of $43,792 per beneficiary aged 65+ with both severe mental illnesses and substance use disorders compared to an average of $8,649 per beneficiary for all beneficiaries aged 65+.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we look for ways to improve our health care system, a focus on better and more affordable care for high-cost, high need beneficiaries is a good place to start.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“By bringing down barriers to better care for the chronically ill in both Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, this draft bill promises to spur delivery and benefit innovation across the health care system. The National Coalition on Health Care calls on the Finance Committee, and then Congress as a whole, to move forward expeditiously with meaningful&nbsp;chronic care legislation.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Better chronic care is fundamental to ensuring health care affordability in the United States.&nbsp;NCHC and its members have long advocated for a strong legislative response, beginning with chronic care in Medicare. We commend the leadership and dedication of the Finance Committee, Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, Senator Warner and Senator Isakson, and their staffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Of course, the details of all these policies will be crucial; NCHC and its members will continue to work with Congress to ensure the strongest possible bill.&nbsp;<strong>But Senators Hatch, Wyden, Isakson, and Warner have given their fellow lawmakers a remarkable opportunity: to demonstrate that bipartisan commitment can produce constructive solutions to health care affordability challenges. Congress should take that opportunity…and with the cost of care steadily climbing, they should take it soon</strong>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Highlights of the draft legislation are listed below:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans will be empowered to deliver care through telehealth technology, deploy non-medical services that help maintain or improve a patient’s health, and lower cost-sharing for patients with chronic illness. MA Special Needs Plans (SNPs), a source of significant innovation in care delivery, will have both new standards to meet and the assurance that the SNP program is permanently authorized. Together with improvements to Medicare’s risk adjustment model included in the draft bill, MA plans would have new tools and resources to deliver great care to their chronically ill enrollees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Original Medicare, beneficiaries will get the chance to choose an Accountable Care Organization by designating an ACO clinician as their primary care provider—in addition to existing attribution mechanisms.&nbsp;ACOs will have the option of prospective assignment, so they can better coordinate care for their patient population. Additionally, ACOs in risk-based payment models will be permitted to offset some beneficiary cost sharing for primary care and will be allowed to deliver services in patients’ homes using telehealth technology. These reforms should help Medicare ACOs better realize their potential to transform payment and delivery in Original Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the discussion draft contains important improvements to the Medicare benefit, broadening coverage of stroke telehealth services and permitting monthly End-Stage Renal Disease check-ups to be&nbsp;delivered via telehealth technology in the patient’s home.&nbsp;It also makes adjustments to the Independence at Home Practice Demonstration that could strengthen the case for making that home-based primary care model a permanent part of Medicare for the frailest Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

<p><strong>Broad Support for Bipartisan Legislation to Expand Access to Data to Improve the Quality and Cost of Health Care</strong><br>Data-sharing bill embodies bipartisanship on health reform</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, D.C. (March 11, 2015) – Today, 37 organizations representing patients, providers, insurers, employers and researchers called on Congress to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that amends the Qualified Entity (QE) statute to allow for broader sharing of Medicare data.&nbsp;<strong>The Quality Data, Quality Healthcare Act</strong>&nbsp;was introduced on March 9th by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and John Thune (R-SD). The House version of the proposal was introduced on February 6th by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joel C. White, President of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage and head of the Clear Choices Campaign</strong>, said, “This bill will put data in the hands of experts who will be able to identify and correct many of the problems plaguing our health system – high cost, poor quality, bad health outcomes. We are encouraging Congress to take the bill up immediately.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legislation will provide more flexibility to data crunchers, known as Qualified Entities, by permitting them to use and share actionable data with providers, payers and health care consumers. The bill revises the QE program by broadening non-governmental access to claims data collected under the Medicare program. Current law, enacted in 2010, gives QEs access only to Medicare claims data (Parts A, B and D), and requires that all analyses be published. The reforms would permit QEs to provide analyses and, in some cases, data for a range of non-public uses, such as assisting providers in developing and participating in quality and patient care improvement activities, population health management, disease monitoring and insurance network development and selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, the legislation will:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Double the amount of&nbsp;data available for analysis;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand the number of experts who can analyze the data; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit more uses of the data, such as for developing new models of care, improving benefit design, or identifying wasteful or unsafe practices.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care</strong>&nbsp;said, “By enabling consumer transparency tools to draw on Medicare’s vast trove of cost and quality data, these reforms will bring us closer to the day when every consumer can access clear understandable cost and quality information on their provider and treatment choices.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing Gains New Members</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Concerned with high prescription drug prices that limit access to life-saving medicines for millions of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C patients, the Fair Pricing Coalition (FPC), the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD), and Project Inform today joined the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a project of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are delighted to become a member of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing as part of our ongoing fight against alarming&nbsp;prescription drug pricing and our advocacy for&nbsp;more and better drug company access programs&nbsp;for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)&nbsp;drugs” said FPC spokesperson Lynda Dee.&nbsp;“Stakeholders need to work&nbsp;together to combat unsustainable prescription drug costs. Gilead’s recent pricing of its new HCV drug Sovaldi at $1000 per pill is&nbsp;a prime&nbsp;example of drug pricing run riot and is&nbsp;the cause of untold access issues&nbsp;for people with both government and commercial insurance coverage.&nbsp;The time is now for us to&nbsp;come together to turn the tide of unreasonable drug pricing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“NASTAD is joining the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that everyone needing access to life-saving medications can get them, particularly those in public payer programs or without insurance” said NASTAD Executive Director Julie Scofield. “We believe this can be accomplished through stakeholder partnerships, and in fact, we have seen successes where this has occurred.&nbsp; But the alarming trend of ever-increasing prices and greater access restrictions threatens these successes. We must reverse this tide in order to continue to see progress in ending the HIV and HCV epidemics.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Project Inform is pleased to join the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing given our commitment to ensuring that people with HIV and HCV can access affordable medications,” said Project Inform Executive Director Dana Van Gorder. “Working in coalition with other organizations is key to addressing the current drug pricing and drug access crisis in the United States. We have the tools to end the HIV and HCV epidemics in the United States. Ensuring that people living with HIV and HCV have access to the medications they need is critical to achieving that&nbsp;mission.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sovaldi is just the first in a coming wave of exorbitantly priced specialty drugs that could bankrupt our health care system,” said NCHC President and CEO and John Rother. “Our system cannot afford prices that threaten to bust state health care budgets, divert funds away from critical health care needs, and force consumers to have to decide between paying for their medicines or their mortgage. We welcome the Fair Pricing Coalition, NASTAD, and Project Inform in our effort to ensure that pharmaceutical innovation achieves maximum impact though affordability and&nbsp;accessibility.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue of unsustainable drug pricing, especially that for “specialty drugs,” is escalating. Seventy percent of new FDA drug approvals in 2013 were specialty drugs, and one estimate notes that by 2020, spending on specialty drugs will quadruple from $87 billion to more than $400 billion. This continued growth in spending is putting significant upward pressure on premiums in the private marketplace as well as in public programs including Medicare and Medicaid</p>

<p><strong>Broad Support for Bipartisan Legislation to Expand Access to Data to Improve the Quality and Cost of Health Care</strong><br>Data-sharing bill embodies bipartisanship on health reform</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, D.C. (March 11, 2015) – Today, 37 organizations representing patients, providers, insurers, employers and researchers called on Congress to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that amends the Qualified Entity (QE) statute to allow for broader sharing of Medicare data.&nbsp;<strong>The Quality Data, Quality Healthcare Act</strong>&nbsp;was introduced on March 9th by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and John Thune (R-SD). The House version of the proposal was introduced on February 6th by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Joel C. White, President of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage and head of the Clear Choices Campaign</strong>, said, “This bill will put data in the hands of experts who will be able to identify and correct many of the problems plaguing our health system – high cost, poor quality, bad health outcomes. We are encouraging Congress to take the bill up immediately.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legislation will provide more flexibility to data crunchers, known as Qualified Entities, by permitting them to use and share actionable data with providers, payers and health care consumers. The bill revises the QE program by broadening non-governmental access to claims data collected under the Medicare program. Current law, enacted in 2010, gives QEs access only to Medicare claims data (Parts A, B and D), and requires that all analyses be published. The reforms would permit QEs to provide analyses and, in some cases, data for a range of non-public uses, such as assisting providers in developing and participating in quality and patient care improvement activities, population health management, disease monitoring and insurance network development and selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, the legislation will:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Double the amount of&nbsp;data available for analysis;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand the number of experts who can analyze the data; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit more uses of the data, such as for developing new models of care, improving benefit design, or identifying wasteful or unsafe practices.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care</strong>&nbsp;said, “By enabling consumer transparency tools to draw on Medicare’s vast trove of cost and quality data, these reforms will bring us closer to the day when every consumer can access clear understandable cost and quality information on their provider and treatment choices.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bill has been included in numerous proposals, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“NASTAD is joining the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that everyone needing access to life-saving medications can get them, particularly those in public payer programs or without insurance” said NASTAD Executive Director Julie Scofield. “We believe this can be accomplished through stakeholder partnerships, and in fact, we have seen successes where this has occurred.&nbsp; But the alarming trend of ever-increasing prices and greater access restrictions threatens these successes. We must reverse this tide in order to continue to see progress in ending the HIV and HCV epidemics.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Project Inform is pleased to join the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing given our commitment to ensuring that people with HIV and HCV can access affordable medications,” said Project Inform Executive Director Dana Van Gorder. “Working in coalition with other organizations is key to addressing the current drug pricing and drug access crisis in the United States. We have the tools to end the HIV and HCV epidemics in the United States. Ensuring that people living with HIV and HCV have access to the medications they need is critical to achieving that&nbsp;mission.”</p>

<p>“Sovaldi is just the first in a coming wave of exorbitantly priced specialty drugs that could bankrupt our health care system,” said NCHC President and CEO and John Rother. “Our system cannot afford prices that threaten to bust state health care budgets, divert funds away from critical health care needs, and force consumers to have to decide between paying for their medicines or their mortgage. We welcome the Fair Pricing Coalition, NASTAD, and Project Inform in our effort to ensure that pharmaceutical innovation achieves maximum impact though affordability and&nbsp;accessibility.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue of unsustainable drug pricing, especially that for “specialty drugs,” is escalating. Seventy percent of new FDA drug approvals in 2013 were specialty drugs, and one estimate notes that by 2020, spending on specialty drugs will quadruple from $87 billion to more than $400 billion. This continued growth in spending is putting significant upward pressure on premiums in the private marketplace as well as in public programs including Medicare and Medicaid</p>

<p>By Ami Patel</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently started looking for a new primary care doctor, and when doing my research, both on the web and by referrals through friends, the doctors with the most enthusiastic support were the ones who were approachable and established a positive, communicative relationship with their patients. As I noticed this trend in categorizing a doctor as great or mediocre based on their communication level, I began to question why the rhetoric of provider groups has not transitioned into focusing more on patient engagement. After all, the doctor is a resource for healthcare information, and when we seek healthcare, there should be full disclosure of what is best for our body and lifestyle. It seems counterproductive when the provider withholds their true opinion in fear of offending or frightening the patient. How can the patient be empowered to take a multifaceted approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle when the doctor fears the patient is not capable of handling such a diagnosis?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This concern was explored in a recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1363511"">study</a>&nbsp;by the&nbsp;<em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>&nbsp;where a project,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.myopennotes.org/"">OpenNotes</a>, was tested to review how patients felt when they knew everything their doctor was saying about them during and after the visit. The study showed doctors tend to be less supportive of such requests due to concerns that their workflow will be disrupted or fear of alarming the patient if such information is unveiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such attitudes and misconceptions about patients and their hardiness to accept their health concerns were unjustified when the study revealed that more patients were enthusiastic about accessing the notes because they felt more in control of their care. The more blunt and candid expression in the notes even had the effect of giving some patients an extra push in making a needed lifestyle change and adhering to the doctors’ advice. Providers benefited by enhancing their communication skills and fortifying the doctor-patient relationship. After all, we typically seek advice from those we trust and respect because it is less likely to be “sugar-coated.” Often times we turn to family and close friends to give us tangible, unmasked, and direct advice; and by applying this approach to the doctor-patient relationship, more trust and respect can likewise be built for the doctor’s opinion.&nbsp; It is a tangible indication that the doctor truly cares for the well-being and overall health of the patient by maintaining an open and honest dialogue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this study, some patients even detected errors in the doctors’ notes and helped clarify these mistakes to avoid unnecessary care. It supported the idea of these notes paving the way to a more approachable path to the doctor. The traditional notion of the doctor always being correct is based on the asymmetry of information that clinicians pose. This traditional relationship should allow flexibility for a more balanced approach to healthcare conformed to the needs of today’s empowered and savvy patient. Many doctors are hesitant to widen the gateway of communication in fear of losing their professional autonomy. Therefore, the open notes policy should benefit both the doctor and patient by alleviating fears of losing control for both parties. An optimal balance in discussing notes and finding solutions can be established by engaging both the patient and provider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The feasibility of having access to doctor notes may have some implementation issues, but the concept of more patient engagement through open communication should be embraced. It engenders a discussion of evolving medical care to fortify the doctor-patient relationship and utilizing innovative methods to pave communication pathways to the patient. Such solutions emphasize the value that doctors place on leveraging communication techniques to empower patients in taking control of their health. Put best, the approach was “a brave effort at pushing the frontier of patient engagement.”</p>

<p><strong>Capitol Hill Forum Inserts Sugary Drinks and Tax Policy into Budget Debate</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care stakeholders, nutrition advocates and budget experts highlighted the role that sugary drinks play in our nation’s rising health care costs and explored proposals to tax those beverages at a Capitol Hill forum today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whether your priority is lower spending or finding the revenue to preserve federal health programs, there are good reasons to put a sugary drinks tax on the table,” said John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC).&nbsp; NCHC cosponsored the event with leading nutrition advocacy group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over recent years, researchers, Congressional Budget Office analysts, and the Domenici-Rivlin budget commission have each highlighted the dual benefits of this tax policy change:&nbsp; $50 to $160 billion in new revenue as well as potentially lower federal spending on the treatment of chronic disease.<a href=""https://nchc.org/capitol-hill-forum-inserts-sugary-drinks-and-tax-policy-into-budget-debate/#_ftn1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp; According to Dr. Michael Jacobson, Executive Director of CSPI, “Taxing soda could be an economic windfall for taxpayers, and a health windfall for all.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacobson spoke as part of an expert panel featuring Dr. Rachel Johnson, Chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee and the Bickford Professor of Nutrition at the University of Vermont, and Chuck Marr, Director of Federal Tax Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.&nbsp; Rother moderated the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Rother, “This is a matter of basic responsibility. If sugary drinks are inflating all our health care bills, why shouldn’t those responsible help cover that cost?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event participants also emphasized that the cost to the public’s health is at least as serious as the budgetary implications. “The nation’s obesity problem is the number one threat to public health today,” said Johnson. “Regular calorie soda and other sugary drinks are the largest single source of calories in the diet of Americans, and studies have shown that their consumption is making the obesity epidemic worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An NCHC issue brief released at today’s forum, “Understanding the Case for Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages,” summarized major findings from the academic literature:</p>

<p>Health care stakeholders, nutrition advocates and budget experts highlighted the role that sugary drinks play in our nation’s rising health care costs and explored proposals to tax those beverages at a Capitol Hill forum today.&nbsp;According to one of the featured panelists, Dr. Michael Jacobson, Executive Director of CSPI, “Taxing soda could be an economic windfall for taxpayers, and a health windfall for all.”&nbsp;Jacobson spoke as part of an expert panel that included Dr. Rachel Johnson, Chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee and the Bickford Professor of Nutrition at the University of Vermont, and Chuck Marr, Director of Federal Tax Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.&nbsp; Rother moderated the event.&nbsp;According to Rother, “This is a matter of basic responsibility. If sugary drinks are inflating all our health care bills, why shouldn’t those responsible help cover that cost?”</p>

<p>In both public programs and the private sector, 5% of patients account for 50% of health care costs. These patients typically face multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations that together lead to enormous health care costs, disability and premature mortality. Better care and services for these often-vulnerable individuals is both a fundamental moral responsibility and an indispensable element of any serious effort to curb overall health care spending.</p>

<h2><strong>A Brief Analysis of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":6} -->
<h6><em>With the release of the Congressional Budget Office score dated June 26, 2017, we offer the following analysis of the Senate bill. We conclude that the legislation, rather than decreasing health care costs from our increasingly unaffordable health care system, serves to shift costs from the federal balance sheet onto state taxpayers, employers and families, and providers.</em></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>CORE COVERAGE PROVISIONS OF THE SENATE BILL</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 would repeal most of the ACA’s tax provisions, offset largely by a 26% reduction in federal support for Medicaid programs operated by the states and territories.[1]&nbsp; It also replaces the Affordable Care Act’s system of tax credits and insurance rules with reduced federal tax credits and new, more relaxed rules for what services and level of coverage insurers must provide. Finally, it broadens state authority to waive most federal coverage and benefit standards. Specifically, this provision of BCRA removes the requirement that states cover as many people and provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive and affordable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>COST SHIFTING TO STATE TAXPAYERS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next ten years, the Senate bill reduces federal support for state Medicaid programs by $772 billion, primarily by capping federal contributions to state Medicaid programs and eliminating funding for state option to cover low-income adults through Medicaid. Cuts of this scale cannot be addressed by new efficiencies and reforms alone.&nbsp; Instead, their implementation would force state policymakers to choose between slashing Medicaid benefits, provider rates, or eligibility, cutting other services like education and law enforcement, or raising state taxes. &nbsp;CBO states:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“With less federal reimbursement for Medicaid, states would need to decide whether to commit more of their own resources to finance the program at current-law levels or to reduce spending by cutting payments to health care providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for enrollment through work requirements and other changes, or (to the extent feasible) arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services.”[2]</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>COST SHIFTING TO MEDICARE AND ITS BENEFICIARIES</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the Senate Bill, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that helps fund Part A benefits will become insolvent two years earlier than previously estimated. This is largely due to the repeal of a dedicated 0.9% increase in Medicare payroll taxes on individuals earning over $200,000 a year and the increase in Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals.[3]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Faced with a $772 billion in reductions to federal reimbursement, states are likely to scale back those benefits and services that are optional under federal law—most significantly the availability of home-based services—and restrict who can qualify for Medicaid-covered nursing home care. The result will be greater utilization of Medicare’s hospital, post-acute, and medical benefits—costs which must be borne by the Medicare beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>COST SHIFTING TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Individual Market Consumers: The Americans who get coverage through the state Marketplaces and receive cost-sharing subsidies will encounter dramatically higher deductibles. Families earning incomes equal to 100-150% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) would be subject to deductibles of about $6000 on Marketplace plans, compared to the approximately $300 deductible available today with cost-sharing reductions.[4] Consumers over 59 years of age will face substantially higher premiums than under current law- reaching as high as 16.2% of their income for those earning 350% of FPL.[5]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For People with Employer-Sponsored Insurance: The 178 million Americans who rely on employer coverage could face higher out-of-pocket costs and a return to lifetime or yearly caps on benefits if their state opts to waive essential health benefit requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>COST-SHIFTING TO PROVIDERS AND PRACTICES</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senate legislation will dramatically increase uncompensated care.The legislation does provide for $42 billion in additional Medicare payments to hospitals serving low income patients. However, these changes would be a fraction of the likely uncompensated care costs resulting from 22 million additional Americans without insurance and unpaid medical bills associated with higher deductibles and other cost sharing on the individual market.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By David Durenberger</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can hear the volume of partisan rhetoric increase in Washington as public confidence in its ability to resolve any complex issue declines. It’s both dumbfounding and discouraging when you consider how prepared Americans really are to embrace real reform if only the people they’ve elected to leadership would level with them — and with each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take health care as an example. We live in a nation in which the cost of coverage has doubled every nine or 10 years while a family’s average real income and buying power has stagnated. The good news is that in the past three years, the health care cost increases have averaged a record low 3.9 percent per year. So something is going on to which policymakers need to pay attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most stakeholders in our $2.7 billion health care industry have decided that enough is enough and got on board the train of systemic health care reform. Their hoped-for destination is an affordable, accessible, high-quality health care system for all Americans. And they have concluded that the only way to get there is for everyone to work to flatten the trajectory of health care spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three years ago, Congress provided a policy blueprint for the journey. Despite all the argument over other aspects of the Affordable Care Act, its systemic reform provisions were built around broadly accepted concepts: rewarding efficient and accountable providers, engaging empowered consumers, promoting a healthier population and rapidly identifying and applying health and health care delivery innovations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this blueprint may need significant improvement, there isn’t a community in America today where health care providers and insurers and consumers are not doing the work of cost-saving, value-raising reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is as it should be. As Americans, we are always looking to do better, to unite around common cause and to back leaders who show us a way forward. That is who we are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in Washington, political polarization now stands in the way of what must be the next leg of the health care journey: making improved health and reduced health spending part of our nation’s fiscal strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am not talking about balancing federal budgets by shifting costs to consumers, providers or the private sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am talking about real reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means replacing the Sustainable Growth Rate payment formula and transitioning Medicare away from fee-for-service toward value-based payment. After all, if Medicare, the largest payer, continues to reimburse most providers for quantity not quality, there is little hope that federal accountable care initiatives or private-sector innovators can successfully tame cost growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means harnessing competition to drive down prices for drugs, medical equipment and other services. Since the creation of Medicare Part D, drug plans have successfully used competition from generic drugs to hold down their costs. Provided that consumer protections are in place, expanding generic use elsewhere in federal programs could save billions. With adequate consumer protections, expanding competitive bidding from medical equipment to other goods and services could save billions more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means engaging consumers in their own health and health care choices. In both Medicare and too many private plans today, benefit design neither supports self-management of chronic disease nor distinguishes between care that is effective and care that is not. A more value-based benefit could be an important step forward — provided that such a structure focused on improving care, not just shifting costs to beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, real reform looks beyond federal programs to scrutinize increasingly uncompetitive private-sector hospital markets. In recent years, anti-competitive contracting practices and inadequate antitrust enforcement have allowed large hospital systems to dominate local markets. When markets are devoid of competition, health systems can respond to cost containment initiatives not by making care more efficient but by shifting costs to other consumers and plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform as outlined here is consistent with the principles of both political parties. It would generate a good deal of the savings needed to resolve our fiscal challenges, and surprisingly, an array of voices stand ready to help in such an effort. As one example, the National Coalition on Health Care, where I serve on the board of directors, has already marshaled support from a broad alliance of consumer, provider, business and health plan groups behind a specific plan to advance these ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most important, a real reform agenda might just manage to enlist the one constituency with the greatest stake in the health care affordability — the American people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By David Durenberger</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can hear the volume of partisan rhetoric increase in Washington as public confidence in its ability to resolve any complex issue declines. It’s both dumbfounding and discouraging when you consider how prepared Americans really are to embrace real reform if only the people they’ve elected to leadership would level with them — and with each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take health care as an example. We live in a nation in which the cost of coverage has doubled every nine or 10 years while a family’s average real income and buying power has stagnated. The good news is that in the past three years, the health care cost increases have averaged a record low 3.9 percent per year. So something is going on to which policymakers need to pay attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most stakeholders in our $2.7 billion health care industry have decided that enough is enough and got on board the train of systemic health care reform. Their hoped-for destination is an affordable, accessible, high-quality health care system for all Americans. And they have concluded that the only way to get there is for everyone to work to flatten the trajectory of health care spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three years ago, Congress provided a policy blueprint for the journey. Despite all the argument over other aspects of the Affordable Care Act, its systemic reform provisions were built around broadly accepted concepts: rewarding efficient and accountable providers, engaging empowered consumers, promoting a healthier population and rapidly identifying and applying health and health care delivery innovations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this blueprint may need significant improvement, there isn’t a community in America today where health care providers and insurers and consumers are not doing the work of cost-saving, value-raising reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is as it should be. As Americans, we are always looking to do better, to unite around common cause and to back leaders who show us a way forward. That is who we are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in Washington, political polarization now stands in the way of what must be the next leg of the health care journey: making improved health and reduced health spending part of our nation’s fiscal strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am not talking about balancing federal budgets by shifting costs to consumers, providers or the private sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am talking about real reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means replacing the Sustainable Growth Rate payment formula and transitioning Medicare away from fee-for-service toward value-based payment. After all, if Medicare, the largest payer, continues to reimburse most providers for quantity not quality, there is little hope that federal accountable care initiatives or private-sector innovators can successfully tame cost growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means harnessing competition to drive down prices for drugs, medical equipment and other services. Since the creation of Medicare Part D, drug plans have successfully used competition from generic drugs to hold down their costs. Provided that consumer protections are in place, expanding generic use elsewhere in federal programs could save billions. With adequate consumer protections, expanding competitive bidding from medical equipment to other goods and services could save billions more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform means engaging consumers in their own health and health care choices. In both Medicare and too many private plans today, benefit design neither supports self-management of chronic disease nor distinguishes between care that is effective and care that is not. A more value-based benefit could be an important step forward — provided that such a structure focused on improving care, not just shifting costs to beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, real reform looks beyond federal programs to scrutinize increasingly uncompetitive private-sector hospital markets. In recent years, anti-competitive contracting practices and inadequate antitrust enforcement have allowed large hospital systems to dominate local markets. When markets are devoid of competition, health systems can respond to cost containment initiatives not by making care more efficient but by shifting costs to other consumers and plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real reform as outlined here is consistent with the principles of both political parties. It would generate a good deal of the savings needed to resolve our fiscal challenges, and surprisingly, an array of voices stand ready to help in such an effort. As one example, the National Coalition on Health Care, where I serve on the board of directors, has already marshaled support from a broad alliance of consumer, provider, business and health plan groups behind a specific plan to advance these ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most important, a real reform agenda might just manage to enlist the one constituency with the greatest stake in the health care affordability — the American people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift from the notion of “medicine as treatment” to “medicine as prevention.” Rather than treating illness and disease, the push for prevention hopes to manifest better population health and well-being plus lower health care spending. If we are going to be serious about improving population health and investing in the future of this nation, we need to be serious about investing in children’s health, including an understanding of and focus on the social determinants of health.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May 12, 2017</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Chairman Hatch &amp; Ranking Member Wyden:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write today to offer the National Coalition on Health Care’s support for key provisions of S. 870, the Creating High-Quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act, and to suggest steps to further strengthen the legislation as it moves forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, employers and other payers, and taxpayers. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s largest and leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. Our member organizations represent—as employees, members, congregants, or volunteers—more than 150 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC applauds the introduction of this legislation and commends your efforts on chronic care, an issue that is vital to affordability in Medicare and across our health care system. We are pleased to support the following provisions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 201, Providing Continued Access to Medicare Advantage (MA) Special Needs Plans for Vulnerable Populations: MA Special Needs Plans have served as incubators for promising delivery and benefit innovations, enabling plans to develop new ways of managing chronic disease and coordinating care for some of the sickest Medicare enrollees. This important provision ensures that they can continue to play that role.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 301, Adapting Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees: NCHC supports the expansion of the MA VBID demonstration to all fifty states and U.S. territories. As currently implemented, this demonstration includes important beneficiary protections, including the requirement that cost-sharing is reduced rather than increased and uniform notice requirements. The national expansion of this model test can better inform the development of future reforms to align benefit structures with ongoing value-based provider-payment reforms and lower cost barriers to needed care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 302, Expanding Supplemental Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees: This important provision will ensure plans can deploy services that may not be covered under Medicare but can improve health outcomes and lower costs. Examples of such services should include, but need not be limited to, non-covered transportation, nutrition, in-home support services, behavioral health services, palliative care services, home improvement, communication devices, caregiver training and support, assistive devices, and remote patient monitoring systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Telehealth Provisions: Certain telehealth provisions of the CHRONIC Care Act are consistent with NCHC-supported telehealth legislation—the CONNECT for Health Act (S. 1060). We are pleased to support the following provisions:</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 102, Expanding Access to Home Dialysis Therapy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 304,&nbsp;Providing Accountable Care Organizations the Ability to Expand the Use of Telehealth</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 305, Expanding Use of Telehealth for Individuals with Stroke</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 401, Providing Flexibility for Beneficiaries to be Part of an ACO: This provision makes needed improvements to the Medicare Shared Savings Program, including the option to assign beneficiaries to ACOs prospectively in all MSSP tracks and through beneficiary attestation. Should the voluntary attestation provision be enacted, we hope that you will work closely with CMS to ensure a robust coordination and outreach effort that extends beyond mere notification. Properly implemented, Section 401 represents an initial down payment on the reforms that are needed to ensure ACOs realize their potential to improve Original Medicare.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a whole, the introduced legislation has potential to improve health outcomes and lower costs over time. But given the scope of the chronic disease challenge, the Committee can and should do more—particularly with respect to the highest-cost, highest-need beneficiary populations. To that end, we urge improvement in three specific areas of the bill:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Broaden the Expansion of Independence at Home: The expansion of the Independence at Home Practice Demonstration from 10,000 to 15,000 beneficiaries, included in Section 101, would be a constructive step. But given the success of home-based primary care in the IAH Practice Demonstration<a href=""https://nchc.org/chronic-care-act/#_ftn1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;and previously at the Veterans Health Administration,<a href=""https://nchc.org/chronic-care-act/#_ftn2"">[2]</a>&nbsp;the Committee should not delay a broader expansion. NCHC supports the Independence at Home Act (S. 464), which converts IAH to a nationwide, voluntary program within Medicare. If it is impossible to include full conversion, the Committee should, at a minimum, expand the IAH Practice Demonstration to 50,000 beneficiaries and five years. This would allow providers in additional geographies to gain experience with this transformative care model and broaden the evidentiary base for its formal evaluation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Incorporate Bipartisan Steps to Support Advanced Illness Care: Advanced illness care is an important part of chronic care. During the last Congress, NCHC expressed support for S. 1549 Care Planning Act. We understand that an updated version of that legislation is nearing introduction. At a minimum, we would urge incorporation into the CHRONIC Care Act of provisions supporting advanced illness quality measure development, updating the Medicare and You handbook, and testing an Advanced Illness Care Model. Together, these policy changes can deliver meaningful improvements in outcomes and care experience for Medicare beneficiaries living with advanced stages of cancer, Alzheimer’s, dementia, renal disease, heart failure, or other conditions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit MA Plans Flexibility to Invest in Non-covered Telehealth Services: As introduced, Section 303 of the CHRONIC Care Act is an important step forward, but we believe the language should be strengthened to better align with that of the NCHC-supported CONNECT for Health Act (S. 1060). Telehealth is not a separate and distinct service, but rather a modality that enables providers to deliver already covered care in a way that improves health and lowers the cost of care without increasing utilization. An overly prescriptive approach that lists specific services that are and are not permitted may limit innovation and investment in telehealth interventions with potential to achieve significant outcome improvements and cost savings.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, we reiterate NCHC’s support for providing ACOs and other alternative payment model entities increased clarity on their ability to furnish other upstream interventions that Medicare typically does not cover, such as social services, transportation, nutritional therapy, or remote patient monitoring. We regret that the Committee’s interest in this vitally important issue, discussed in the December 2015 Policy Options document, was not directly reflected in the introduced legislation. If this issue remains unaddressed in S. 870, we would encourage the Committee to quickly turn to this topic in subsequent legislative efforts this year.</p>

435,"BETTER MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES SUBJECT OF CONFERENCE, REPORT","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost 80 percent of the $1.5 billion total U.S. health care expenditures is used to treat people with chronic diseases, yet only a minority of the more than 125 million who suffer from those diseases receives the most appropriate medical care, according to experts at a national meeting held today in Washington, D.C., on&nbsp;<strong>""Raising the Bar: Improving Quality of Care for the Chronically Ill Through Best Practices and Public Policy.""</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting was sponsored by the&nbsp;<strong>National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC)</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)</strong>&nbsp;as part of an initiative to identify innovations that improve the quality of care, to document their impact, and to disseminate that information to all parties involved in health care, including providers, purchasers, and consumers. The Institute of Medicine hosted the meeting at the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speakers at the conference included representatives from the institutions profiled in the report issued today,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/""><strong><em>Curing the System: Stories of Change in Chronic Illness Care</em></strong></a>. They described actions they have taken that could and should be adopted or adapted by the nation's health care system and that could dramatically improve the quality and control the cost of chronic disease care. The expert team that selected those profiled in the report was headed by Edward Wagner, M.D., M.P.H., Director of the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation, at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Improving the management of chronic diseases is extremely important to improving the quality of health care,"" said Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., president of the National Coalition. ""However, it is only one part of the much greater task we have before us, and one which has been documented by numerous reports, including those of the NCHC, the Institute of Medicine, the IHI, and the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. We need to address the total problem of the overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services and to change the way medicine is practiced in this country accordingly,"" he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition is the nation's largest, most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care system. It is non-partisan and non-profit, and its members include large and small businesses, unions, consumer, provider and religious groups, foundations, and health and pension funds. Its Honorary Co-Chairs are former Presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald R. Ford. Former Governor Robert D. Ray (R-IA) and former Congressman Paul G. Rogers (D-FL) serve as Co-Chairs of the Coalition.</p>

<p>THE STATE OF OUR NATION'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM: WHY STATE GOVERNMENTS MUST BE CONCERNED<br>BY<br>HENRY E. SIMMONS, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P. PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE NATIONAL CONVERENCE OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS<br>PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND<br>JUNE 12, 1999</p>

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about the state of our nation's health care system. As you know, our nation began its last major health care debate during the Presidential campaign of 1992 at which time both candidates agreed that our health care system was already in crisis. That attempt at major reform ended without action in 1994. Only one thing has changed since then. That is: all of the problems which existed then have grown worse, and because of that, you in state government, and those you serve, now face far more serious problems then would have been the case if appropriate reforms had been enacted five years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As elected officials, you have a special responsibility for the health and welfare of the citizens of your states. As citizens, you also are stakeholders in our nation's health care system. Thus, from both perspectives, and for reasons I will enumerate, I believe you must become advocates for major reforms at both the state and the national levels. Otherwise, you will fail in your responsibilities and our problems will continue to grow worse, to the detriment of all Americans and all the states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been asked to do three things today: first, to do a ""reality check"" on our health care system and its problems; second, to describe how these problems will affect your state, its citizens, and our nation; and third, to describe the reforms which will be necessary to address the problems. In doing so, I will share with you the views of the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to achieve comprehensive health system reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with our effort, our members include over 80 organizations, businesses large and small, including giants such as Ford, DaimlerChrysler and GTE, labor unions, the nation's three major religious faiths, its largest consumer organizations, including AARP, and the organizations representing the nation's primary health care providers and academic health centers. Our members either represent or employ over 100 million Americans. We are non-partisan. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford, and George Bush honor us as Co-chairs. Our working Co-chairmen are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray (R-Iowa) and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers (D-Florida). We also have many prominent individual supporters including former Senators Mitchell and Dole, and House Minority Leader Bob Michel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past year, our Coalition has released eight major studies assessing our health care system. These, as well as others, show that our nation, and those you serve, face three major, interrelated systemwide problems which are growing worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PROBLEM #1 IS RISING COSTS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five years ago we were told we didn't need any major reforms because the market and managed care were the solution. This prompted a massive shift from fee for service to managed care in which over 85% of the nation's workforce, and many of your constituents, are now enrolled. Despite that, health care costs have increased almost 500 billion dollars since 1990 and large and small employers and individuals in your states are facing premium increases at six to ten times the inflation rate with no end in sight. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that with current trends, our total costs will almost double to over two trillion dollars in just eight years. This in turn will lead to a major increase in the number of uninsured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a whole range of reasons which time will not permit me to enumerate, you in state governments and those you represent will bear a substantial share of those new costs due to cost shifting. This cost shifting could grow worse as the federal government further constrains payments to providers in order to control its costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Employers will be forced to transfer at least part of their health care premium increases to their employees. Our studies show that middle income families, those with children and incomes between $20,000 and $60,000 - that is, half of all Americans and most of your constituents - will lose the highest percent of their income due to health care inflation. This large and inequitable hidden income tax will adversely affect the standard of living and take home pay of our nation's middle class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So problem number one is rising costs, which although already higher on a per-capita basis than those of any other nation, will double again to over two trillion dollars in just eight more years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PROBLEM #2 IS DECREASING INSURANCE COVERAGE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rising costs, in turn, are a major cause of our second problem which is decreasing insurance coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under our present system, much of our huge cost increase will be cost-shifted from federal to state governments and to those businesses and individuals in your states who currently pay for insurance coverage. As health care costs rise ever more rapidly, more employers, especially small businesses, will be forced to either shift costs to their employees or other employers, drop or decrease coverage, or hire contingent workers without health insurance. This is already occurring, and, as a result, the nation's largest private sector health safety net, i.e., the employment based health insurance system, is deteriorating. There has been a particularly ominous drop in employment based coverage for those over age 61. This drop in coverage is particularly severe in the case of early retirees. The previously tight link between employment and health insurance coverage is increasingly tenuous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are already at a point where almost 80 million Americans -- that's one of every three under the age of 65 -- are either uninsured or underinsured. 43 million people are now uninsured. This is 10 million more than when the most recent health care debate began. Despite a booming economy, more than one million Americans are being added to the ranks of the uninsured each year. Just imagine what awaits us in the next and inevitable recession. Our recent report has estimated that when recession comes, the number of uninsured will reach 60 million. An equally large number will likely be underinsured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This must concern all states because the growing burden of covering the uninsured and underinsured will be shifted as a new cost to state governments and private sector payers, especially small businesses and individuals. As our problems grow more severe, this national ""shell game"" of cost shifting will intensify and it will not stop unless and until we achieve universal coverage. This is another reason we cannot deal with the Medicare problem in isolation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, as the employment based system continues to erode, the businesses who currently employ and continue to insure your constituents will become less and less competitive as they have to bid against competitors who do not provide or who cut back on coverage. This creates an unlevel playing field which will lead more businesses to drop or cut back coverage in order to remain competitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PROBLEM #3 IS POOR QUALITY</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given our cost and coverage problems, we can understand why government and private sector payers are focusing on cost control. But that then compounds our third problem, the quality of our care. Despite the fact that we have long known of the difficulty in containing costs if quality is poor, to this point the health care debate has focused almost exclusively on cost. This has led to efforts by federal and state government and the private sector to control costs predominantly by limiting fees, increasing beneficiary cost sharing, and increasing the use of managed care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a large and growing body of evidence raises questions as to whether any or all of these approaches will, over the long term, contain costs. For the evidence shows that the major driver of rapidly rising cost is increasing intensity of care and a sharp increase in our use of technology, especially for care of the growing number of elderly. This fact raises the critical question: Just how good is the quality of our care? Here the evidence is even more ominous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people have at least some understanding of the magnitude of the cost and coverage problems. But very few understand that our third problem, poor quality, is even more serious and that unless it is addressed, the cost and coverage problems cannot be fixed. The reason is that these three problems are inextricably linked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As already noted, cost escalation leads to an increase in the number of uninsured. In the absence of insurance coverage, needed care is becoming increasingly difficult to get. When this happens, health and quality in turn suffer. In fact, studies show that, other than aging, the biggest risk factor associated with a poor outcome or death is the lack of health insurance. Whether or not you receive care (which is now determined largely by your insurance status) can determine whether you live or die. So lack of insurance intensifies our already existing quality problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, there is an abundance of evidence which shows that poor quality wastes hundreds of billions of dollars each year. This, in turn, is a major cause of cost escalation. So we see here the vicious cycle which feeds on itself; i.e., poor quality raises costs, rising cost leads to cost shifting and decreasing coverage, decreasing coverage leads to poor quality and poor quality in turn increases costs. We've built a perpetual motion machine headed in the wrong direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past year alone, four major reports have all concluded that our health care system is ""plagued with overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services."" Harvard researchers have concluded that malpractice and medical negligence constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic."" And yet, despite the magnitude of our problem, our current one trillion--and soon to be two trillion--dollar health care system continues to operate in a virtual quality control vacuum. As a result, it is estimated that 3 million Americans are unnecessarily injured, hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted and more than 120,000 Americans die each year as a result of errors, preventable medical injuries, or negligence. This is the equivalent of two fully loaded jumbo jet crashes every three days with a total loss of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not meant to infer that my fellow physicians and health care professionals are trying to harm people; they are trying to do the best they can. But the fact of the matter is, they work in a flawed system with inadequate data and quality control. These flaws have to be acknowledged and fixed in a ""no-fault"" environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no other business in this country that any state would allow to continue to operate even a day with quality problems of that magnitude, nor would society pay more than a trillion dollars a year for its services. Yet this is now the case in our health care system. This serious quality problem exists in every state of the union, even in our supposedly pre-eminent health care institutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the problems. They are large, they are serious, they are growing worse, and there is no end in sight. These problems are adversely affecting the millions you represent and they existed long before the advent of managed care. So where do we go from here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We feel that at present, neither the public nor many of its political leaders really understand how serious the problems are and why comprehensive change will be necessary. At the same time, we recognize that necessary change is unlikely to occur unless and until the public and its leaders have a better understanding of the facts, and a broader and shared vision of a better, more equitable and affordable health care system, with assurance that it can be achieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Achieving that common understanding will require a major educational effort. With our members' support and substantial grants from several of the nation's largest health foundations, our Coalition has dedicated itself to help create such an effort. We hope each of you will consider making your states a part of this effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we are to have a rational dialogue on health care, and ultimately achieve necessary reforms, what do we believe are some of the most important things for the public and its' leaders to understand?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First: We believe we must all recognize this problem is not going to go away. It will grow worse. We cannot address these systemwide problems by dealing with the Medicare problem alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second: The public must be helped to understand that they and the majority of Americans are now at risk. This is now a serious middle class issue. None other than the wealthy can feel assured that coverage will continue to be there when they or their families need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third: We must recognize that we won't be able to control cost, or afford universal coverage or even know what to provide coverage for unless we address the quality problem. Quality is a central problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fourth: We must recognize that partial reforms will not be sufficient, and none of our current approaches, including Medicare reform, market forces, medical savings accounts, new tax provisions, benefit redesign, cafeteria plans, managed care, or a bill of rights will, by themselves, be powerful enough to address our problems. Each can make a contribution, but we will ultimately need a far more comprehensive strategy, one which integrates more rationally Federal, State, and private sector policies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important here to remind ourselves that our past failure to do so has resulted in the creation of the most expensive, administratively complex, and non-user friendly system on the face of the earth. One which now expends tens of billions of dollars each year just to push paper through the system. This is a terrible waste which is completely unnecessary. Fifty nonintegrated state policies, including the wide variety of mandates, are a major contributer to this administrative nightmare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifth: Because our problems are too large and complex to be addressed by any one sector alone, we believe the nation and each state needs to proceed in partnership with the private sector in a ""no-fault"" manner to achieve a variety of reforms including the development of a credible and publicly accountable quality measurement and quality assurance system. A national commitment to improve quality, a quality ""moonshot"" if you will, must be a major element of our national and each state's strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each state can also help achieve necessary reforms through the use of your power to regulate the health insurance market and the delivery system, including managed care, through how you utilize your authorities in the Medicaid and CHIP programs, and through more prudent use of your authority to mandate benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are some important things that must be done which states cannot do alone. And this leads me to our Coalition's final conclusion, which is that to solve the problems which face us, our nation will ultimately have to achieve the following goals:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Making sure every American has health insurance coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Controlling total system costs and stopping cost shifting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Improving the quality of all care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Creating a more viable and equitable mechanism of financing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Simplifying administration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why must all of these goals be achieved? Because all the evidence shows that our three problems are inextricably intertwined. You can't solve one without addressing them all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a vicious cycle. Without system wide cost containment strategies, you cannot assure or afford universal coverage, without universal coverage, you cannot assure quality, and in the absence of quality, you cannot contain costs. In addition, without universal coverage you can neither create a truly competitive system, make the system less complex, control costs, stop risk selection and cost shifting, or achieve a level playing field of equitable financing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, we believe there is a way to build a more equitable, more affordable, and higher quality system and the states have a major role to play in that process. For a trillion dollar expenditure, we believe that the American people have the right to expect no less. I wish you the will and the wisdom to discern how to best contribute to that important effort, for without your help, the problem won't be solved.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning. In discussing health care spending in the private sector, I am going to share with you the collective experience and viewpoints of a unique alliance of organizations that for over a decade has worked to develop an understanding of the problems we face, and then advance policy options and prepare the groundwork necessary to address them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The National Coalition on Health Care is the nation's largest and most broadly representative non-partisan health reform alliance. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford serve as our Honorary Co-Chairs. Our Co-Chairs are former Iowa Governor Robert D. Ray, a Republican, and former Florida Congressman Paul G. Rogers, a Democrat. Our 80 members reflect a wide range of political views. Members include large businesses, such as Safeway, AT&amp;T;, and SBC Communications; many of the nation's largest consumer, provider and labor organizations, such as AARP and the AFL-CIO; and organizations representing our country's three major religious groups, which happen to be among our largest employers. This religious involvement positions us to raise the serious ethical issues inherent in our troubled system.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, two of the nation's largest health and pension funds have recently joined us. Carl McCall, Comptroller of the State of New York and Sole Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, is a member, as is CalPERS (the California Public Employees' Retirement System). These two organizations alone serve as fiduciaries for more than three million individuals and control more than 250 billion dollars worth of corporate and other assets. And we're seeing more and more interest. Additional funds like these will join our reform effort.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Collectively, our current members employ or relate to over 100 million Americans. They control or influence many tens of billions of dollars of health care purchasing power. And I think the signal is clear: There is a lot of power -- not only political power, but financial power -- mobilizing around the issue of health care reform.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I give you this background because the broad experience of our members in individually attempting to deal with the health system's problems is very relevant.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the basis of our Coalition's experience, I want to offer you six observations to consider about private health care spending and efforts by employers and other private payers to contain or constrain it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation one: We have not one, but three systemic problems: rising costs, decreasing coverage, and pervasive, destructive, and expensive quality problems. These problems are interrelated and growing worse. To successfully deal with one, we must deal with them all.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation two: What is most striking about the very large premium increases we are now seeing is not just their magnitude, but the fact that they are taking place now. Let me explain.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We've already heard in this conference the news about large premium increases. Earlier this week, Hewitt Associates reported that preliminary HMO increases for 2003 are averaging 22 percent - nearly 7 percent higher than the increases Hewitt found for this year. Premiums are rising at the fastest real rates in history. All of these increases are occurring, of course, at a time of low general inflation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is especially worrisome is that we are seeing these startling premium increases even though employers, especially large employers, have become quite sophisticated about health care purchasing. Many of them had a great deal of success in the middle and late 1990s in stabilizing their health care costs. Now their efforts are of little avail. Health care premiums, for even the largest and smartest purchasers, are out of control.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A case in point: CalPERS, the nation's second largest purchaser of public employee health benefits and a new member of our Coalition. After years of success in holding down its cost increases for coverage of 1.2 million people, CalPERS now finds that its good fortune has run out. In 2003, CalPERS faces a premium increase of 25 percent. This comes after a 13 percent increase this year, and double digit increases are likely to continue.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mid-April, Bill Crist, the president of CalPERS, told David Broder of the Washington Post,<br><br><em>""In 1992, we hadn't taken advantage of our position in the marketplace. But soon after that, we standardized our benefits and invited the managed care companies that were entering our market to compete for our business. That competition for market share held costs down, and for several years, we gained national prominence for actually lowering premiums. But we've pretty much wrung out what we can through competition.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broder then observed that ""virtually every other corporate and individual purchaser is facing the same problem as CalPERS.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation three: Increasing health care costs for employers - and sharply rising premiums in the non-group market - will increase the number of Americans without health insurance. In a study we commissioned, the Lewin Group found that, over time, a one percent real increase in insurance premiums is associated with an addition of 300,000 to the ranks of the uninsured. On this basis, our Coalition estimated in a recent report, ""A Perfect Storm: The Confluence of Forces Affecting Health Care Coverage,"" that due to cost escalation, the number of uninsured Americans may have increased in 2001 and 2002 by 6 million.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation four: Let's not kid ourselves: Many of the new wave of ostensible cost containment tactics that employers are edging towards - increased cost-sharing, defined contributions - are in fact ways to shift costs, not contain them. If and as more companies move in this direction, we will see the employee share of health care spending continue to rise. The effect would be the equivalent of a wage decrease - with some added disadvantages.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With increased cost sharing through higher deductibles and co-payments, more and more employees would put off needed health care for financial reasons - the very scenario that health insurance is meant to protect against. And with defined contributions, many would drop coverage altogether because of sharp increases in the costs of maintaining it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How sharp might those increases be? Consider a brief, simplified example. Let's suppose that beginning this year, a large company decided to cap its contribution to family coverage at 80 percent of last year's premium, adjusted in subsequent years for increases in the CPI. If last year's premium for family coverage was $7,000, the firm's contribution that year would have been $5,600, with an employee expected to pay the remaining $1,400.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let's assume that the premium for family coverage increases 15 percent a year in 2002, 2003, and 2004 - and that the CPI increases 2.5 percent a year in each of those years (for our purposes, a conservative assumption because it is slightly above current estimates). Under these assumptions, the family premium would jump to $10,646 in 2004. The employer's contribution would increase from $5,600 in 2001 to $6,031 in 2004.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By contrast, the employee's share of the premium would more than triple, from $1,400 in 2001 to $4,615 in 2004 - an increase of $3,215 in just three years. How many moderate-wage employees would be able to pay $4,615 a year - not even counting deductibles and co-payments - to secure health coverage? How many would have to forego coverage for themselves and their families?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation five: Over time, employers can make progress on their cost problems, and improve the quality of care that employees and their families receive, by working more closely with health plans and providers to spread the use of best practices and best processes for care. That progress does not depend on politics. There is no excuse for not moving forward now.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gaps and shortfalls in the quality of American health care have been receiving increasing attention recently - in part because of the two landmark reports prepared and issued by the Institute of Medicine and in part because of our studies on quality and the unstinting efforts of outstanding researchers and leaders in the medical community.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Coalition has launched a new effort called the Best Processes Initiative. Working with Don Berwick and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, we will develop tools for purchasers, providers, and patients to encourage and reward the adoption of practices and processes to improve care and reduce unnecessary expenditures. We plan to begin with practices and processes for the care of chronic diseases - building on a report we issued last month, with funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Berwick, who has studied these issues extensively, has offered the following assessment: ""Even with modest assumptions about defect rates in health care, total cost reductions of nearly 30 percent below current levels should be attainable."" Clearly, identifying the full range of opportunities to reduce health care costs by reducing errors and improving quality - and then implementing the needed changes in practices and processes - is a long-term effort. It will take large amounts of leadership, organizational change, and investment. But this is a long-term effort that should be pursued with a real sense of urgency - not just (or even principally) to save money, but to save lives and prevent harm.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Institute of Medicine has reminded us that there is a chasm between the quality of health care that many Americans should receive and the quality of care they actually do receive - and that the consequences of this gap are dire: millions of preventable injuries and hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. Quality is a cost issue, yes, but it is also, without exaggeration, a matter of life and death. Just think of the irrationality: We currently spend $1.5 trillion a year to pay for health care, and we spend a pittance to improve its quality or to reform the system. If there is any less sound public policy, I don't know what it is.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observation six: We will need major new public policy initiatives to respond to surging health insurance premiums. Here, I want to share with you a portion of a letter that Bill Crist of CalPERS just wrote to state health funds. He starts out by saying: ""CalPERS joined the National Coalition because we've determined that there must be an intensified effort to obtain federal government focus in confronting the current destructive increases in the cost of health care. The Coalition's commitment has clear humanitarian dimensions, but for CalPERS the decision to support it is essentially pragmatic.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here's the key paragraph:<br><br><em>""At the present time, CalPERS is confronted with increases in health insurance premiums that are so great as to destroy our ability to provide health care protection our members deserve and expect. In our opinion, neither current market economic forces nor current public policies offer any hope for relief from those accelerating prices. We know that these same conditions confront all organizations, public and private, that are charged with similar responsibilities.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All of the members of the National Coalition on Health Care - from many sectors of the American economy and society - share that assessment. As I have suggested in these remarks, health care costs affect, and are affected by, the quality of care and the extent of uninsurance. Public policy change needs to reflect that interconnectedness; health care reform is a multivariate equation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must create a massive effort, public and private, to improve the quality of all care and to eliminate that waste of hundreds of billions of dollars and the unnecessary carnage that it causes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must control total health system costs -- not just for Medicare, not just for the big buyers, but for everybody. Other industrialized nations have managed to contain costs while covering all of their citizens; we can, too. And we must stop the national shell game of cost-shifting.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What reforms does the Coalition believe will be necessary?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our members have concluded that a solution will require a comprehensive strategy that effectively integrates federal, state, and private sector policies to achieve the following goals:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Assuring health insurance coverage for every American;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improving the quality of all care;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Controlling total system costs and stopping cost-shifting;</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simplifying administration.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see, cost containment is one, but only one, of these essential goals. Why must all these goals be achieved? Because, as I said earlier, our problems are inextricably intertwined; we cannot solve one without addressing them all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's a vicious cycle. Without system-wide cost containment strategies, you cannot assure, afford, or sustain coverage for all. Without coverage for all, you cannot assure quality, and in the absence of quality, you cannot contain costs or make rational payment decisions. In addition, without coverage for all, you can neither create a truly competitive system, make the system less complex, control costs, stop risk selection and cost-shifting, nor achieve a level playing field of equitable financing. Remember that those who developed the managed competition market hypothesis also concluded that coverage for all would be necessary to make it work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We recognize that it will not be easy to achieve these ambitious reforms. We must get the public and our political leaders to understand that there is a great deal of unfinished business in health care, and that business has to be addressed now. We are convinced that health care will be the transcendent domestic issue in our society in this decade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We also recognize that right now the political dynamic for major reform is timid and stalled. The immediate task is to change the public perception and the present political dynamic. At a Coalition meeting this week, our members agreed to make this our highest priority over the next two years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude: Given the Coalition's assessment of the problems, what are our answers to the major questions that are the subject of this conference?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""start"":1} -->
<ol start=""1""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Should health care costs be contained? Absolutely, because unless they are contained none other than the wealthy can be assured they will have health care coverage when they need it or continue to be able to afford the coverage they now have. We strongly support major systemic cost containment efforts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Can health care costs be contained without harming patients? Yes, but not with the strategies we are currently using or contemplating.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Must the system be restructured? Yes, from top to bottom.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What will be necessary to control cost? Major national policy changes and the abandonment of our 40-year-old patchwork strategy. We reject as unacceptable and unworkable any strategy that focuses on cost containment alone. We should never think of costs without at the same time thinking of the need for health insurance coverage for all and quality improvements.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must make a concerted effort to elevate health care quality on the national agenda and to be sure that quality and cost receive equal consideration in decisions we make. A difficult task? Yes, but one that must be completed. Otherwise, our great-grandchildren will be attending not the ninth, but the 109th Princeton conference, the topic of which will be why we didn't do what was necessary in health care reform sooner.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good Afternoon and thank you for joining us for this briefing on the state of our nation's health care system.<br><br>The views you will be hearing are those of the National Coalition on Health Care - which is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to understand and to address the serious problems in our health care system. Our Coalition is rigorously non-partisan and has always carried out its decade-long work in a ""no-fault"" manner. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford honor us as Honorary Co-chairs and our Co-chairs are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray of Iowa and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers of Florida. Our 80 members are listed in your handouts and include major corporations, the nation's largest consumer, provider and labor groups, as well as all the nation's major religious faiths. Our members relate to, represent or employ over 100 million Americans.<br><br>The principles we have long supported are as follows:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Health insurance for all</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improved quality of care</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Cost containment</li>

<li>Equitable financing, and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simplified administration</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a long period of intensive analysis, we have concluded that our health care system has three serious and interrelated problems - rising costs, decreasing coverage, and very serious and pervasive quality problems. We have further concluded that systemic problems of this magnitude cannot be solved by a ""patch work"" strategy and that 40 years of national experience attests to the bankruptcy of such an approach. In fact, we will soon be releasing a separate study which establishes and quantifies the shortcomings of a piecemeal approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of you are probably familiar with the national best selling book ""The Perfect Storm"", which chronicles the formation and unleashing of the most powerful storm in this century. It occurred because of the unprecedented confluence of nature's most awesome forces. As with most storms there were warnings, and those who ignored those warnings lost their lives. We are here today to report that a Perfect Storm has now formed in our health care system. But unlike nature's storm, this one will not abate in short order. In fact, there is no end in sight, and there is reason to expect ever increasing intensity and damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will show today that the set of circumstances we now face is unprecedented. Never in our history have we faced this number of forces and of this magnitude simultaneously. If unaddressed, the consequences will be devastating to tens of millions of Americans and to our society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real tragedy here is that none of the tools we are currently using -- or currently contemplating - including a Patient's Bill of Rights, tax changes or MSA's -- have even a remote chance of successfully addressing our problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, this storm has been brewing for some time, long before the economic downturn and the events of September 11th. For example, we have long known that even a robust economy will not solve our large and chronic problem of the uninsured. Despite a decade of the most vibrant economy in recent history, more than five million people were added to the ranks of the uninsured. Long before September 11th, we were warned that our nation has no plan to meet the health care needs of our 77 million baby boomers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long before the economic downturn and September 11th, we were warned by the Institute of Medicine and others that our health care system was ""broken"" and needed comprehensive restructuring and major improvement. More than two years ago, we were warned by the President's Quality Commission that our health care system was plagued with errors and with overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services. As a result, millions of preventable injuries and over 100,000 deaths occurred yearly. Months ago, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill warned a Senate hearing that because of our lack of attention to quality, our nation was wasting 30-50% of the 1.3 trillion dollars we were spending in health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than a year ago, and at a time of unprecedented budget surpluses, the CBO warned that rising health care costs were the largest single force that was going to drive our nation back into unsustainable budget deficits and that this would continue unless major changes were made at every level in health care. And finally, though we have long known that delivery system consolidation would make it even harder to get desirable competition into our system, consolidation has proceeded at an accelerated pace. And despite all these warnings, very little was done to prepare for the storm which is now upon us. We believe our nation and our people are about to pay a heavy price for such inaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For what has suddenly changed is that, on top of these existing major problems, new and even more powerful forces have been laid which will have devastating consequences. These include health care premiums that are expected to increase five times the rate of general inflation -- the greatest margin of increase in our history -- and a serious economic recession, with resultant major increases in the number of unemployed and uninsured. And now, layered over these forces, we face international terrorism which could suddenly impact the health of tens of millions of our citizens. Never have we seen such forces converge on our society and never before have they posed such a threat to the middle class. We believe our nation and our political leaders must again return to dealing with this transcendent domestic crisis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So with this as background, we now want to share with you the data behind our conclusions and our projections of the impact these forces will have on the American people and our economy. I want to stress that the projections you will hear use ""Best Case Scenarios"" and are very conservative. We actually feel the problems could become far worse than our projections.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you, Stan, for your generous introduction, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>Stan has just given you an excellent description of one of the critical problems in our health care system - i.e. rapidly rising costs, which will, with present trends, double in just seven more years. This is a disturbing finding in its own right but becomes even more so when you consider that despite that huge and rapidly growing expenditure, our nation's health status is no better, and in fact in a number of important areas is worse, than that of other developed nations, all of whom spend far less per capita than we do. It is simply a myth that we need more money and more medical care to produce better health. In fact, often the exact opposite is true, i.e. more health care leads to worse, not better health outcomes. So there are a number of reasons why we should be disturbed about rising costs. But costs are not the only problem.<br><br>I have been asked to describe the two other critical problems which exist, and how they and the cost problem are interrelated. Then I will describe how these three problems, if left unaddressed, will adversely affect your millions of members and their families, as well as our nation.<br><br>In my judgment, the two central health care questions facing you as NEA leaders are, first: how can NEA's tremendous political leverage and purchasing power be mobilized to improve the quality and value of care for your members. The second is - how can NEA work more effectively to help achieve the health system reforms necessary to address the problems our nation and NEA's members face.<br><br>Since your members currently use tens of billions of dollars worth of health care each year, and since much of that huge and rapidly growing expenditure is currently wasted, it is important that NEA leadership succeeds in achieving better quality and value for those you represent.<br><br>There are many barriers which will have to be dealt with if you are to succeed. I have been asked to describe these barriers and what you and our nation will have to do to overcome them. I will conclude by suggesting to you a series of steps NEA can take, which could dramatically improve quality and safety and the health and welfare of your participants and their families and, at the same time, save billions of dollars.<br><br>The most important message I want to leave with you today is that, to achieve those goals, you will have to do many things far differently in the future than you have done in the past.<br><br>The views I will share with you are those of the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to achieve comprehensive health system reforms. Our members include NEA, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of School Administrators, as well as most of the nation's major unions, consumer, religious and provider groups, and a number of large businesses. We are non-partisan. Former presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford serve as honorary co-chairs. Former Iowa Republican Governor Bob Ray and former Florida Democratic Congressman Paul Rogers are our working co-chairs. Our 80 members represent or employ over 100 million Americans.<br><br>Our Coalition is working on three parallel tracks. The first focuses on building the case - and making the case - for system-wide health care reform. This involves issuing studies on the major problems in our health care system and then educating leaders in various sectors of American society, that is the press, members of Congress and the executive branch about these problems and the need to address them.<br><br>The second track focuses on current legislative debates that Coalition member organizations decide collectively to impact - by testifying and through meetings with the Administration and the Congress.<br><br>The third track of our work is our Quality Improvement Initiative which reflects a recognition by the Coalition's members that even as they work collaboratively to affect public policy, there is a real opportunity to use the leverage of their individual and joint purchasing power to create real improvements in the care they buy. I will describe this Quality Improvement Initiative later in my presentation.<br><br>But first, what are the health care problems you as NEA's leaders face? There are three, and they are interrelated.<br><br><strong>PROBLEM #1 RISING COSTS</strong><br><br>The first problem has already been described to you and that is costs - which are now out of control. Despite all your efforts to date, your premium costs are likely to rise annually at 4 - 5 times the inflation rate. In a very short time your already high health care costs will double and there is no end in sight.<br><br>Those most adversely and unfairly affected by rising costs will be employers, such as yours, who currently provide health insurance, and middle-class workers and their families, i.e. your members.<br><br>Rising health care costs will also have a huge negative impact on our economy. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that even under the most optimistic scenario in which every cent of the surplus was used to pay off the national debt, the future cost of paying for health and retirement benefits will break the federal budget. The CBO concluded that ""runaway"" health care costs are the largest single force that will drive our nation back into unsustainable deficits and that this will continue unless major changes are made at every level of our health care system, i.e comprehensive system reform.<br><br><strong>PROBLEM #2 IS DECREASING INSURANCE COVERAGE</strong><br><br>Largely due to rapidly rising costs, coverage is decreasing and the employment-based health insurance system, i.e. the system which covers most of your members and their families, is eroding. As the next chart shows, there are 10 million more uninsured today than a decade ago. Over time, an average of almost one million more Americans are added to the ranks of the uninsured each year. Most of these are from working families. We are already at a point where almost 80 million Americans are either uninsured or underinsured. That's one out of every three non-elderly Americans. The economic downturn which is underway is likely to dramatically add to those already high numbers.<br><br>As costs rise and as coverage falls, more costs will be shifted to employers who currently provide coverage to pay the costs of care for the uninsured. Ultimately, those costs will be passed along to their employees and your members in the form of lower wage increases, reduced benefits, or higher out-of-pocket costs. This inequitable cost-shift will force more employers to drop or cut health insurance or go to defined contributions, and the erosion of the employment-based system will increase. Those who lack coverage will find it increasingly difficult to get timely care and thus their health is likely to be adversely affected.<br><br><strong>PROBLEM #3 IS POOR QUALITY</strong><br><br>These first two problems are bad enough. But this is not all. There is a third major problem, i.e. poor quality, which I want to focus on today. Many people have at least some understanding of the magnitude of the coverage and cost problems, but very few understand that our third problem, poor quality, is even more serious and that unless it is addressed, our coverage and cost problems cannot be fixed. The reason is that these three problems are inextricably linked.<br><br>Any good businessman knows that if you don't pay attention to quality, you could end up wasting 35-50% of all that you spend. In recent Congressional testimony, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who has served as one of our important individual supporters and who has extensively studied the quality problem, stated that in his judgment this high percentage waste is now the case in our health care system. Lack of attention to quality then could result in more than 350 billion dollars of waste each year.<br><br>Even though we have long known how difficult it is to contain costs in any sector if quality is poor, to this point in health care the focus, and NEA's focus in bargaining, has been almost exclusively on cost. This has led to efforts to control costs by limiting fees, increasing beneficiary cost-sharing, decreasing benefits, and increasing the use of managed care.<br><br>A large and growing body of evidence raises questions as to whether any or all of these approaches will, over the long term, contain costs. The reason is that the major drivers of rapidly rising cost are increasing intensity of care and a sharp increase in our use of technology, especially for care of the growing number of chronically ill and the elderly. This raises the critical question: Just how appropriate is the use of our technology and how good is the quality of our care?<br><br>A discussion of the quality problem is very timely, because Congress has been attempting to craft a ""Patients' Bill of Rights Act"" to ""fix"" the quality problem which has allegedly been caused by managed care. This is a graphic illustration of how poorly understood the quality problem is.<br><br>We do have very serious quality problems, but the real problems are not due to managed care and will not be solved by more appeals, greater access to specialists, more second opinions, more choice, an increased right to sue, or unlimited amounts of health care.<br><br>The reason is that the major underlying cause of our quality problem is not bad health professionals, though there are some. Poor quality is mostly due to inadequate science, a lack of evidence-based medicine, inadequate technology assessment, deficiencies in our data and major gaps in our quality control, standard setting, and information dissemination systems. In other words, we have a structurally flawed system.<br><br>As a result, too often no one, specialist or not, knows the right thing to do. The uncertainty which pervades much of medical practice today is manifested by the huge variation in care which exists from region to region, doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital. For example, breast cancer surgery rates for similar conditions vary 33 fold across the nation and there are many other examples of scientifically unjustified high variations in use. In fact, the next time you hear someone claim that we have the best health care system in the world, you can reasonably ask, ""Which one?"", because the type of health care delivered varies dramatically depending not on need or solid evidence, but on where you receive your care. Dr. Jack Wennberg, of Dartmouth, puts it succinctly when he says: ""In health care, geography is destiny."" With so many different approaches being applied to similar patients, it is not possible that all physicians are doing the ""right thing"".<br><br>Medical accidents and errors are rampant in our health care system. The President of Kaiser Permanente has stated that, ""Extrapolating from what we know, one can conclude that the third leading cause of death in the United States, just behind cancer and heart disease, is fatal mistakes that occur as a result of the misuse of our medical technologies."" He estimates that this results in millions of preventable injuries and more than 250,000 preventable deaths each year.<br><br>Dr. Lucian Leape, of Harvard, has estimated that one in every 300 hospital admissions ends in a preventable death, making hospitals one of the most dangerous settings in our nation.<br><br>But as big as the problem of errors is, they are only a part of the quality problem. After a year of study, the President's Quality Commission concluded, ""Exhaustive research documents the fact that today, in America, there is no guarantee that any individual (insured or not, rich or poor) will receive high-quality care for any particular health problem. The health care system is plagued with overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services"". These problems exist everywhere, in managed care, in fee-for-service, and in our supposedly preeminent institutions. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences recently released its second quality report. The report concluded, and the majority of the nation's health care providers now agree, that our health care system is ""broken"", and IOM called for a major system overhaul and a major national quality improvement effort.<br><br>There is no other business in this country that would be allowed to continue to operate even a day with quality problems of the magnitude I have described, nor would society pay more than a trillion dollars a year for its services. Yet this is now the case in our health care system.<br><br>The question I believe you as leaders of NEA now need to ask yourselves is why do you and your members continue to pay for and waste billions of dollars to perpetuate and reward a system this flawed?<br><br>Here's where some prevalent myths become barriers to action. For instance, some honestly believe there are quality problems elsewhere, but not with ""my"" doctor or ""my"" hospital. Some feel that report cards on the system will fix its problems. Some feel that if it wasn't for managed care or the insurance companies or the bureaucrats, the system would be just fine. Some feel we just need to spend more money to fix the system. All of these are myths. The fact is the system is structurally flawed, and pitifully little is being done to fix it. We as a people and you at NEA continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars per year to support the present deeply flawed system and virtually zero to reform it or to improve its quality.<br><br>We know we can do far better. There is absolutely no doubt that we can, and fortunately tools are now becoming available to help you do just that. Time will not permit me to describe them all, but let me review several which our Coalition has developed.<br><br>Under a two-year federal grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), our Coalition and the internationally respected Institute for Healthcare Improvement have launched a joint initiative - Accelerating Change Today (A.C.T.) for America's Health - to identify and disseminate exemplary cases of quality improvement in health care and to facilitate the adoption of such better practices by providers, health care plans, insurers, and consumers.<br><br>Our A.C.T. initiative has already released authoritative reports on best practices in two areas - how to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety, and how to improve care at the end of life. Both demonstrate how dramatic improvements have been made by a wide variety of health care institutions. They show the way. They can now be replicated by other institutions. And that's where NEA's leverage in the negotiation process with health care plans and providers becomes important. Using your bargaining leverage and purchasing power you and other large health care negotiators can cause these ""best practices"" to be rapidly adopted by the providers who care for your members.&nbsp;<strong>There is no longer any excuse for the status quo</strong>. We will soon have available two other important case studies on how to improve care in our intensive care units and how to improve care for the 125 million Americans with multiple chronic diseases.<br><br>We recognize that the development of best practices case studies is only the first step. In order to assure that such best practices are applied to the care of your beneficiaries, your negotiators will need additional tools which must still be developed. Our Coalition is prepared to develop these tools with you and we are currently in discussion with your leaders and staff of a number of the nation's largest unions and Taft-Hartley plans to raise the resources necessary to complete this process. Lynn Ohman, Stan Wisniewski, and Mike Kahn deserve a great deal of credit for recognizing the need here at NEA for a major system reform and quality improvement effort.<br><br><strong>WHAT ELSE MUST BE DONE AND WHAT LESSONS HAVE WE LEARNED?</strong><br><br>As I noted at the beginning, although quality is a central problem and one which you can impact, it is not the only problem which must be addressed. How do we deal with the totality of the systemic problems we face? We know how not to do it. We know we can't do it with band-aids or patches or partial reforms such as a bill of rights or changes in tax treatment of health care benefits. We have forty years of experience attesting to the failures of partial strategies. Partial steps can make a contribution, but more extensive reforms will be necessary. What are those reforms?<br><br><strong>STEPS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS OUR PROBLEMS</strong><br><br>After a great deal of study, our Coalition has concluded that solution will ultimately depend on the achievement, through a public/private partnership, of the following goals:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Making sure every American has health insurance coverage;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improving the quality of all care;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Controlling total system costs and stopping cost shifting;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creating a more viable and equitable mechanism of financing; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simplifying administration.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why must all these goals be achieved? Because all these problems are inextricably intertwined. You can't solve one without addressing them all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I indicated earlier, it's a vicious cycle. Without universal coverage, you cannot assure equity or quality, and in the absence of quality, you cannot contain costs. In addition, without universal coverage you can neither make the system less complex, control costs, stop cost-shifting, achieve a level playing field of equitable financing, or create a truly competitive market-based system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To those who claim that our nation cannot afford a system of universal coverage we would say this: Every other advanced nation in the world has done so while spending one half to two thirds as much per capita as we do and attaining health outcomes at least as good as, and in a number of areas better than ours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a major cause of unnecessary harm and cost escalation, quality has become a central problem. Since there is no greater opportunity to control costs than by improving quality, it is essential that you as NEA leaders allocate the resources necessary to allow your staff to mount an extensive effort to address the issue of quality now. As I said earlier, our Coalition is prepared to help your staff develop the tools and processes that will enable you to do so, but substantial additional resources will have to be allocated to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, no matter how hard you try, your actions alone cannot solve the whole problem you face nor achieve the essential reform of universal coverage. Nor can you alone stop the deterioration of the employment based health care system or stop cost shifting to you and your members. These are going to require national policy changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But believe me - the needed reforms will not happen unless those currently hurt by the status quo, i.e., those such as you, become much more active and effective and better resourced. Last year, groups opposing necessary reforms spent over $120 million lobbying their views, while those supporting needed reforms were badly underfunded. This must change because the system will not correct itself as long as you and other payers are willing to spend 1.3 trillion dollars on the status quo. The system will not change as long as the public and your members fail to understand the magnitude and severity of the problem and demand change. It will not change if payers and consumers don't find a way to identify, reward and support those providers and systems who want to, and who are ready to provide better quality and value. Until leaders such as you begin to use your influence, your credibility with your members and your considerable economic and political leverage, the system will not change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As fiduciaries for millions of NEA members, I believe you have an obligation to channel much more of your energy and multi-billion dollar annual health outlay into efforts to make major quality improvements and to reform the system. If you and others like you do so, this system will change and it will change rapidly to the benefit of the millions you represent and to the nation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working together NEA and the other members of the National Coalition on Health Care can and will make a difference. In doing so, we will create a better, more equitable, and more affordable health care system.</p>

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to be with you and for your help.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on rising health care costs and how employers and employees are responding to those increases. I am Dr. Henry Simmons, President of the National Coalition on Health Care. The Coalition is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care. The Coalition was founded in 1990 and is non-profit and rigorously non-partisan. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford are our honorary Co-chairs and our Co-chairs are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray of Iowa and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers of Florida. Our members include major corporations, the nation's largest consumer, religious and labor groups, as well as health care provider groups and our nation's largest health and pension funds. Collectively, our 80 members employ or represent more than 100 million Americans. Our membership list is attached to my written statement.<br><br><strong>The Rising Costs of Health Insurance</strong><br><br>National health care spending is rising rapidly and this year will exceed $1.54 trillion - more than $5,400 per capita. That is four times what we spent on health care in 1980, and the total bill is expected nearly to double to $2.8 trillion by 2011. Our per capita health care costs are far higher than those of any other industrialized nation and our health outcomes are no better.<br><br>The premiums that employers, employees, and individuals pay for health insurance are rising at the fastest real rates in history. On average, premiums jumped 12 percent last year and - depending on plan type - are projected to increase 12 to 16 percent this year. Hewitt Associates recently reported that preliminary HMO increases for 2003 are averaging 22 percent - nearly 7 percent higher than the increases Hewitt found for this year. Out-of-pocket costs are also rising rapidly.<br><br>These huge increases are occurring at a time of low general inflation. Why? And why should Congress, employers and the public be concerned?<br><br><strong>Causes of Rapidly Rising Health Insurance Premiums</strong><br><br>The recent and ongoing surges in health insurance premiums are being driven by a confluence of two sets of forces, old and new, which have come together to create the equivalent of a ""perfect storm"" in health care.<br><br>The first set - traditional cost drivers - includes a mix of:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Poor quality, waste and inefficiency due to inadequate quality control, inadequate science and a structurally flawed health care system</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Advances in medical technology</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increasing service intensity</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The high costs of end-of-life care</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>High administrative costs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>State mandates</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To these have now been added a new set of forces - emerging cost drivers --which include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A longer and deeper insurance underwriting cycle, designed to help insurers and health plans make up for premium shortfalls in recent years</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increased use of medical technology</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Pressures from Wall Street on for-profit health plans to raise premiums in order to increase profits</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Escalating prescription drug costs and utilization</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Diminished competition due to provider consolidations and tougher negotiations with health plans for higher reimbursements</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The medical needs and demands of 77 million baby boomers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Soaring medical malpractice insurance premiums and, with them, an increased tendency for physicians to order extra tests and make treatment decisions that limit their risks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consumer demands for easier and broader access to care, and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How Are Employers and Employees Responding?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In answer to the Subcommittee's question as to how employers and employees are responding to rapidly rising costs, the answer is very poorly. In fact, in the absence of major national policy changes and system restructuring, they will be unable to deal with the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Should Congress, Employers and the Public Be Concerned?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, we have not one, but three systematic problems - rising costs, decreasing coverage, and pervasive, destructive, and expensive quality problems. These problems are interrelated and growing worse. To successfully deal with one, we must deal with them all. Whatever employers and other private sector payers have been doing to contain costs isn't working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, what is especially worrisome is that we are seeing startling premium increases at a time of low general inflation and even though employers, especially big companies, have become more sophisticated about health care purchasing. Health care premiums for even the largest and smartest employers are out of control. Costs for small businesses and individuals are rising even more rapidly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, increasing health care costs for employers and employees - and sharply rising premiums in the non-group market - will produce dramatic increases in the number of Americans without health insurance. The Coalition estimated in its recent report, ""A Perfect Storm: The Confluence of Forces Affecting Health Care Coverage,"" that due to cost increases the number of uninsured Americans may have increased, just in 2001 and 2002, by 6 million. A summary of our report is attached to my written testimony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fourth, many of the new wave of ostensible cost containment tactics that employers are edging towards - increased cost-sharing, defined contributions - are in fact ways to shift costs, not contain them. If and as more companies move in this direction, we will see the employee share of health care spending continue to rise. The effect would be the equivalent of a wage decrease - with some added disadvantages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With increased cost sharing through higher deductibles and co-payments, more and more employees would put off needed health care for financial reasons - the very scenario that health insurance is meant to protect against. And with defined contributions, many would drop coverage altogether because of sharp increases in the costs of maintaining it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifth, we have created a perpetual motion machine in health care, which is headed in the wrong direction. All our problems are growing worse and present policies and procedures will not be powerful enough to enable employers and employees to address these problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition believes that we will need a major new public policy initiative to respond to surging health insurance premiums. Our members are working to encourage a renewed national debate about the large-scale issues facing American health care - and about the options for system-wide reforms that will be necessary to contain costs, achieve coverage for all, improve the quality of care, assure equitable and sustainable financing, and simplify administration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We commend the Subcommittee for beginning the process through today's hearing and we appreciate the opportunity to share with you our members' views and experiences. I would be pleased to answer any questions.</p>

<p>PRESENTATION TO THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE FORUM<br>LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS<br>GOVERNOR CALVERT HOUSE<br>ANNAPOLIS, MD<br>MARCH 17, 1998</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good afternoon. Because of my respect for the work of the League of Women Voters, I am especially pleased with this opportunity to discuss with you the state of our nation's health care system. As you know, our nation began, and the League was a part of, a major health care debate during the Presidential campaign of 1992, at which time both candidates agreed our health care system was already in crisis. That attempt at reform ended without action in 1994, and many breathed a sigh of relief assuming our problems had been solved. Only one thing has changed since then. That is, all the problems which existed then have grown worse, and because of that, you, your families, and our nation now face more serious problems than would have been the case if appropriate reforms had been enacted six years ago.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been asked to do three things today: first, to review the present state of our health care system and its problems; second, to describe how these problems will affect us all; and third, to outline the reforms which will be necessary to address them. In doing so, I will share with you the views of the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to achieve necessary health system reforms.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the League of Women Voters, we are rigorously non-partisan. Presidents Carter and Ford honor us as co-chairs and our 93 members touch the lives of over 100 million Americans. Our Coalition includes a number of the nation's largest corporations, its major unions, provider and consumer groups as well as all three of our nation's major religious faiths. Our concerns include the ethical and moral problems associated with a troubled health system.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today's meeting occurs as the nation, the Congress, and the administration prepare for yet another debate on health system and Medicare reforms and a Consumer Bill of Rights. The Medicare Commission has just begun its work; the President's Quality Commission has just submitted its recommendations; and the managed care debate is increasing in its intensity. We commend those who are working on these issues, but we are concerned that as a nation we have failed to learn from the mistakes of the past and continue to consider patchwork reforms to deal with the symptoms instead of with our underlying problems.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The debate to this point on a variety of partial reforms and a Consumer Bill of Rights constitutes a graphic case in point. Let me explain. Last month our Coalition released a series of studies to serve as a reality check on the state of the nation's health care problems. These studies showed that we face three interrelated and growing problems. First, our costs are out of control. Despite the recent and really quite modest pause in growth, costs continue to rise at 2 á times the inflation rate and are far higher than they need to be. All other developed nations are providing necessary health care services to all their citizens at about one-half to two-thirds of our costs, and their people are as healthy, or healthier than we are, and polls show they are far more satisfied with their system of care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In just the past 5 years costs have risen more than 500 billion dollars, and despite the explosive growth of managed care, our studies and Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that our already huge costs will in only 5 more years increase by 500 billion dollars, and double to 2 trillion only 5 years thereafter.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle-income families, those with children and incomes between $20,000 and $60,000--that is, half of all Americans--will lose the highest percent of their income due to health care inflation. This large and inequitable hidden income tax will adversely effect the standard of living and take home pay of our middle class.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rising costs in turn contribute to our second major problem which is decreasing health insurance coverage. We are already at a point where almost 80 million Americans--that's one in three people under 65--are either totally uninsured or underinsured. This is 10 million more than when the health care debate began only six short years ago. In large part, due to rapidly rising costs, one million more Americans are being added to the ranks of the uninsured each year, and many of these are from working middle class families. Because of cost increases, business is hiring more contingent workers and fewer and fewer such employees are provided with health insurance coverage. This occurs especially in our small businesses, which represent the bulk of the nation's economy.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As costs increase, more and more businesses and federal and state governments are forced to cut coverage or shift costs, and as a result, out of pocket costs are growing dramatically and our safety nets, including our present dominant employment based health insurance system, are deteriorating. For all these reasons, the number of uninsured and underinsured will inevitably grow.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worrisome thing is that this cutback in coverage, and the resultant growth in the number of uninsured is occurring in spite of the best economic times in our history, questioning the views of those who claim a rising economy will grow us out of our problem. Just imagine what will happen to the number of uninsured and underinsured, and to the magnitude of cost shifting, when we experience the next and inevitable economic downturn.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before proceeding, it is important to note here the interrelationship between our cost and coverage problems and our third problem which is inappropriate use of technology and poor quality. Both of these result in extensive waste, unnecessary cost escalation and poor outcomes. As already noted, cost increases imperil our safety nets and lead to an increase in the number of uninsured. In the absence of insurance coverage it is becoming increasingly difficult to get needed care. When this happens, health and quality, in turn, suffer. In fact, studies show that, other than aging, the biggest risk factors associated with a poor outcome or death are poor quality or the lack of health insurance. Because of major variations in the quality of care, where you receive care, or whether or not you receive care (determined largely by your insurance status) can determine whether you live or die.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's a vicious cycle. Without cost containment you cannot assure or afford universal coverage, without universal coverage, you cannot assure quality, and in the absence of quality you cannot contain costs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In light of this we have long considered quality a central problem, and quality in our definition is not just choice of physicians and health plans and appeals processes. Quality is doing the right thing, at the right time, with the optimal outcome.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a number of reasons why we are deeply concerned about quality and why the American people should be concerned. First of all, there are major gaps in our scientific knowledge base which contribute to medical uncertainty. Much of our medical technology has been adopted and widely utilized without adequate evaluation. The evidence to justify treatment of even the most common medical and surgical conditions such as prostate cancer and low back pain is often questionable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, there is no credible national database on quality and no national technology assessment or standard setting mechanism. This makes it very difficult for health professionals to practice as well as they would like to practice or as well as you would like them to practice.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Medical uncertainty leads to enormous regional variations in the amount and type of health care delivered with no evidence that those who receive more care have better outcomes than those who receive less care. In his pioneering work on regional variations, Dartmouth's Dr. Jack Wennberg has shown that ""in health care, geography is destiny: the amount of health care consumed by Americans depends more on where they live, the local supply of resources and prevailing practice styles than on patients needs and preferences."" The huge regional variation which exists in medical care is scientifically indefensible. When you next hear someone state that we have the finest health care system in the world, you can reasonably ask: Which one? For medical care is delivered very differently from region to region, hospital to hospital, doctor to doctor. In fact, the literature is replete with studies which show that we physicians disagree with each other and even with ourselves a high proportion of the time. Often no one knows who is right, nor can you the patient know who is right. Because of that, too often neither consumers nor health care professionals are able to make rational decisions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is not to infer that my fellow health professionals are trying to harm people; they are not. But the fact is that they work in flawed systems with inadequate data. These flaws have to be acknowledged and fixed in a ""no-fault"" environment. Adopting mechanisms and policies to do so should be a high national priority.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a speech to the American College of Surgeons, Dr. David Eddy, a noted quality expert, summarized our situation as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""For centuries, the practice of medicine has been based on one huge assumption. The assumption that physicians instinctively know the right thing to do. Somehow, the assumption goes, physicians are able to assimilate all they have learned, process all the information they generate and make the right decision. That myth has been shattered. We are all coming up with different answers and it is impossible for all of us to be correct. Our practices are way out in front of our intellectual lines of supply.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, there is the problem of treatment error. Because our quality control mechanisms are so rudimentary, mistakes are much more common, costly, and harmful than generally realized. There are distressingly high error rates reported in a wide range of medical practices with serious, and often fatal consequences. For example, autopsy studies show high rates (35 to 40 percent) of missed diagnoses, often resulting in death. A recent poll done by the American Medical Association suggests that more than 100 million Americans have been touched by what they consider a medical mistake. Dr. Lucian Leape, a physician board member of the AMA's National Patient Safety Foundation, has estimated that the number of injuries caused by medical accidents in inpatient hospital settings nationwide could be as high as three million and cost as much as $200 billion a year.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tragedies such as these are not isolated events. The ""Harvard Medical Practice Study for the State of New York"" has demonstrated this dramatically. If the New York rates are extrapolated to the country as a whole, then the Harvard researchers estimate that approximately 120,000 people die each year as a result of medically induced injury or negligence. One-half of these deaths, or 90,000 each year, are considered preventable. The Harvard team concluded that medical injury and malpractice constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the way, all these quality problems I have just described were reaffirmed in last week's report of the President's Quality Commission. There is no other business in this country that would be allowed to continue to operate even a day with quality problems of that magnitude, nor would society pay more than a trillion dollars a year for its services. Yet this is now the case in our health care system. The executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine has written that: ""far from being beneficial, much of the medical care in this country is unnecessary, is of no demonstrated value to those who receive it, and some of it is harmful.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are the problems you as consumers and we health professionals face. They are large, they are serious, they are growing worse, and there is no end in sight. These problems existed long before the advent of managed care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let me conclude by talking about solutions. Unfortunately, it appears that none of the incremental approaches which state and federal governments and private sector payers are using will be powerful enough to address our problems.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, where does this leave us? If we are to have a rational dialogue on health care, and ultimately achieve necessary reforms, what do we believe are some of the most important things for the public and for leaders such as you to understand and to do? What is the educational task which faces us, and which, if not accomplished soon will continue to be a major barrier to necessary reforms? Here are four suggestions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, we believe we must help the American people recognize that this problem is not going to go away or be corrected by current approaches. It will grow worse.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, we must all recognize that, for a number of reasons, market forces and competition alone will not solve our problems. Successful markets rely on a fair transaction between an informed buyer and an informed seller. That doesn't exist in health care where the consumer, and often even the provider, is at a severe disadvantage, lacking the information necessary to make an informed decision. Consumers can't buy solely on price because they have insufficient information on quality.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Competition can help contain costs in real markets, but to get competition, you need good information and a wide variety of choices. We're getting the exact opposite as large segments of our health care market move toward more and more consolidation and therefore less competition and choice.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Markets need independent oversight to assure public accountability. There is no such mechanism to protect consumers and payers in today's health care system.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, we all have to recognize that our problems cannot be solved by each of us acting alone, by the private sector acting alone, or by each state acting alone. In fact our health care system, which is already the most complicated on the face of the earth and which costs 100 billion dollars each year to administer, could become an even greater nightmare if 50 states adopt 50 different and uncoordinated policies to deal with our problems.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth, the nation needs to proceed in a ""no-fault"" manner to establish a publicly accountable quality assurance and quality improvement system that will bring together the strengths of the public and private sectors, with the resources and authority necessary to do the job.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, we do need adequate consumer safeguards including a sound ""Bill of Rights."" But in our view, there is no more fundamental consumer right than to be assured that care is evidenced based, effectively delivered and available to all when they need it. Absent these elements, no Bill of Rights will fulfill its promises or meet the public's needs. But more importantly, costs will not be contained and the vicious cycle of increasing costs and cost shifting, decreasing coverage and the resultant poor quality will continue. And without universal coverage, meaningful competition cannot be achieved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe the public must come to understand that because our problems are interrelated, solutions must include, (and indeed, you must insist on) the principles of improved quality, effective cost containment, equitable and stable financing and universal coverage. These are the bedrock principles on which a better and more ethically defensible system must rest. All reforms must be designed to achieve and be judged against these principles.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a very large educational task to be done before the necessity for those principles is understood. Until this is understood, it will be difficult to achieve needed reforms. Recognizing this need, our Coalition has committed itself to that educational effort and you in the League could play an important role. Time does not permit me to discuss this further but we can do so in our question and answer session.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, is there hope? Absolutely. Improved quality, universal coverage, equitable financing and cost containment are not partisan principles, and working in a bi-partisan fashion with the administration and Congress, we believe these principles can be and indeed must be achieved. Can we get there in steps? Yes we can. But the steps have to be designed with the essential principles in mind. This is the task ahead for all of us. We look forward to the possibility of working with the League of Women Voters in the educational efforts necessary to achieve our mutual goals of a better, more equitable and affordable health care system.<br><br>Thank You!</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-table""><table><tbody><tr><td>STATEMENT AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB FORUM:<br>""THE STATE OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM: WHAT MUST BE DONE ABOUT ITS PROBLEMS.""<br>BY HENRY E. SIMMONS, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., PRESIDENT<br>NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE<br>WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>JANUARY 26, 1998<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us has been asked to share our organization's views on the state of our health care system and the steps necessary to resolve its serious and growing problems.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Coalition is the nation's largest and most broadly representative, non-partisan health care alliance. Presidents Carter and Ford honor us as co-chairs and our 93 members represent or employ over 100 million Americans. Our Coalition includes all three of our nation's major religious faiths, and our concerns include the ethical and moral problems associated with a troubled health system, as well as the issues of cost and coverage.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today's forum occurs as the nation, the Congress and the administration prepare for a major debate on health system and Medicare reforms and a Consumer Bill of Rights. We commend those who are working on these issues, but we are concerned that as a nation we have failed to learn from the mistakes of the past and continue to adopt patchwork reforms to deal with the symptoms instead of with our underlying problems.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The debate to this point on a variety of partial reforms and a Consumer Bill of Rights constitutes a graphic case in point. Let me explain. Recently, our Coalition released a series of studies to serve as a ""reality check"" on the nation's three major health care problems. They show that the health care crisis, acknowledged by both Presidential candidates in '92 is not only still with us, but is in fact growing worse and that the problems of poor quality, rising costs, and decreasing coverage are interrelated and therefore cannot be dealt with in isolation from each other.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the explosion in growth of managed care, our costs continue to rise at twice the rate of inflation. Today's one trillion-dollar system will double in cost to two trillion dollars in the next decade. This will adversely impact our economy, the deficit, the nation's small businesses and the middle class's standard of living. A major factor increasing costs is poor quality and the resultant extensive waste and poor outcomes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Largely due to rising costs, our safety nets, including the employment-based health insurance system are deteriorating , and the number of uninsured, mostly middle class working Americans is increasing at a rate of over 1 million each year. At this moment there are over 40 million Americans without any health insurance and an equal number of underinsured. We know that in the absence of insurance coverage, or cross subsidies, it is increasingly difficult to get needed care. The result is that health outcomes and quality suffer. In fact, studies show that, other than aging, the biggest risk factor associated with a poor outcome or death is the lack of health insurance. Whether or not you receive timely and needed care (determined largely by whether you have insurance) can determine whether you live or die.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's a vicious cycle. In the absence of quality you cannot contain costs, without cost containment you cannot assure or afford universal coverage, and without universal coverage, you cannot assure quality.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In light of this we have long considered quality a central problem, and quality in our definition is not just choice and appeals processes. Quality is doing the right thing at the right time in the right place with the optimal outcome.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The causes of our quality concerns include truly massive and indefensible regional variations in medical care, high error rates, gaps in our knowledge and databases, and inadequate technology assessments. Health professionals today work in flawed systems with inadequate quality controls and data. This leads to errors and unnecessary harm. Harvard studies have concluded that medical negligence and malpractice constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of these system deficiencies and the resultant misuse of technologies, hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted, millions are injured and tens of thousands die unnecessarily each year. Quality experts note that no other industry would be allowed to operate even a day with a quality and safety record such as this. These quality problems existed long before the advent of managed care, and are found even in the nation's preeminent institutions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the seriousness of these problems, our nation has no integrated system for assessing or assuring quality. Nor do we have in place the necessary standard setting mechanisms. This makes it very difficult for health professionals to practice as well as they would like, or as well as the American people would like.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What steps are needed to deal with these interrelated problems? First, we believe we have to recognize that neither the market, managed care, medical savings accounts, voluntary action nor the private sector alone will be able to correct problems of this magnitude. We will need a major national commitment to universal coverage and cost containment, coupled with a quality ""moonshot,"" if you will, with the resources necessary to set priorities and goals, fund necessary research and develop the needed systems and data.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, the nation needs to proceed in a ""no-fault"" manner to establish a publicly accountable quality assurance system that will bring together the strengths of the public and private sectors, with the resources and authority necessary to do the job.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, we do need adequate consumer safeguards including a sound ""Bill of Rights."" But in our view, there is no more fundamental consumer right than to be assured that care is evidence based, effectively delivered and available to all when they need it.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity to address you on the state of our nation's health care system. As you know, our nation began a major health care debate during the Presidential campaign of 1992 at which time both candidates agreed our health care system was already in crisis. That attempt at reform ended without action in 1994, and many in the public and the business sector breathed a sigh of relief assuming our problems had been solved. Only one thing has changed since then. That is: all the problems which existed then have grown worse, and because of that, you and those you serve now face more serious problems than would have been the case if appropriate reforms had been enacted six years ago.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As legislators, you have a special responsibility and mission: protecting the health of the citizens of your states. As citizens, you are also stakeholders in our nation's health care system. For both reasons, and because these problems are serious, I believe you must become advocates for major reforms at both the national and state levels. Otherwise, you will fail in your responsibilities to those you are entrusted to serve, and our problems will continue to grow worse to the detriment of all Americans and all the states.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been asked to do three things today: first, to do a ""reality check"" and give you an update on the state of our health care system and its problems; second, to describe how these problems will affect your constituents and our nation; and third, to describe the reforms which will be necessary to address the problems and the possible role of state governments. In doing so, I will share with you the views of the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to achieve necessary health system reforms.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our members include over 90 organizations, businesses large and small, ranging from giants such as Ford and Chrysler, to the 4,000 small business members of the National Electrical Contractor's Association, a dozen of the nation's largest labor unions, the nation's three major religious faiths, its largest consumer organizations and the organizations representing the nation's primary health care providers and academic health centers. Our members either represent or employ over 100 million Americans. We are non-partisan. Our honorary Co-chairs are former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford. Our Co-chairmen are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray (R-Iowa) and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers (D-Florida). We also have many prominent individual supporters including former Surgeon General Koop and Ann Landers.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last month our Coalition released studies on the nation's critical health care problems. They showed that you and those you serve face three interrelated and growing health system problems. First, our costs are out of control. Despite the recent and modest pause in growth, costs continue to rise at 2‡ times the inflation rate and are far higher than they need to be. All other developed nations are providing necessary health care services to all their citizens at about one-half our costs, and their people are as healthy, or healthier, than we, and far more satisfied with their system of care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the growth of managed care, our studies and Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that our already huge costs of a trillion dollars yearly will increase by 50% or 500 billion dollars over the next 5 years and double to 2 trillion dollars only 5 years thereafter. Due to a lack of purchasing leverage, individuals and small businesses in your states will be particularly hard hit with this cost escalation and, in one way or another, state governments will bear a substantial share of those new costs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle-income families, those with children and incomes between $20,000 and $60,000--that is, half of all Americans--will lose the highest percent of their income due to health care inflation. This large and inequitable hidden income tax will adversely effect the standard of living and take home pay of our middle class and many of those you represent.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, major problem number one is rising costs, which have risen by over 50% or more than 500 billion dollars since the reform debate started in the early nineties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rising costs in turn contribute to our second major problem which is decreasing health insurance coverage. We are already at a point where almost 80 million Americans--that's one in three people under 65--are either totally uninsured or underinsured. This is 10 million more people than when the health care debate began only six short years ago. In large part, due to rapidly rising costs, one million more Americans are being added to the ranks of the uninsured each year, and many of these are your constituents from working middle class families. Because of cost increases, more contingent workers are being hired and fewer and fewer employees are provided with health insurance coverage especially in our small businesses, which represent the bulk of the nation's economy. In fact, the fastest growing segments of our economy are small businesses in the service sector, where fewer and fewer jobs come with adequate health insurance coverage.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As costs increase, more and more businesses and governments are forced to cut coverage, and our safety nets, including our present dominant employment based health insurance system, are deteriorating. Since we have nothing ready to replace them, the number of uninsured and underinsured will inevitably grow. The growing burden of covering the uninsured will be shifted as a new cost to private sector payers, especially small businesses and your state budgets. Private sector payers are becoming society's insurers of last resort. This is a classic example of the systemic and interrelated nature of the problems we face and how they disproportionately hit private payers ñ especially the many small business payers you represent. In the absence of major systemic reforms, this cost shift from the Federal to state government and private sector payers is inevitable and will grow. In addition, because of resultant higher employment costs, the businesses who currently employ and insure your constituents will become less and less competitive as they have to bid against competitors who do not provide or who cut back on coverage. This creates an unlevel playing field which will lead more businesses to drop or cut back coverage in order to remain competitive. This is another reason why universal coverage is essential.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worrisome thing is that this cutback in employer based coverage is occurring in spite of the best economic times in our history, questioning the views of those who claim a rising economy will grow us out of our problem. Just imagine what will happen to the number of uninsured and underinsured, and to the magnitude of cost shifting, when we experience the next and inevitable economic downturn.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Given our cost problem, we can understand why government and private sector payers are focusing on cost control. But that then compounds our third problem, the quality of our care. We should all be concerned that despite the known close relationship between cost and quality, and the difficulty in containing costs if quality is poor, to this point the health care debate has focused almost exclusively on cost. This has led to efforts by government and the private sector to control costs predominantly by limiting fees, increasing beneficiary cost sharing, and increasing the use of managed care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, a large and growing body of evidence raises questions as to whether any or all of these approaches will, over the long term, contain costs. For the evidence shows that the major driver of rapidly rising cost is increasing intensity of care and a sharp increase in our use of technology, especially for care of the growing number of elderly. This fact raises the critical question: Just how good is the quality of our care and what do we health professionals and you, the payers and consumers, know about this technology?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indications are we don't know nearly enough. There are major gaps in our knowledge base, which contribute to medical uncertainty. Much of our medical technology has been adopted and widely utilized without adequate evaluation. The evidence to justify treatment of even the most common medical and surgical conditions is often questionable. This includes such common conditions as prostate cancer and low back pain, which affect millions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, there is no credible national database on quality and no national technology assessment or standard setting mechanism. This makes it very difficult for health professionals to practice as well as they would like or as well as you would like.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Medical uncertainty leads to enormous regional variations in health care with no evidence that people in regions with access to more care have better outcomes than people in regions with less care. Let me give you an example. In Miami, admission rates to Intensive Care Units for Medicare patients are 5 times greater than for similar cases in Sun City, Arizona with no difference in outcome. The percentage of Medicare enrollees who are admitted to an intensive care unit some time during the last six months of life varies regionally from less than 9% to more than 47%. In his pioneering work on regional variations, Dartmouth's Dr. John Wennberg has shown that, ""in health care, geography is destiny: the amount of health care consumed by Americans depends more on where they liveóthe local supply of resources and prevailing local practice stylesóthan on patients' needs or preferences.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wennberg suggests that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is in the public interest for each state to consider adopting universally the lower levels of acute care hospital resources, physician workforce, and spending of regions where resources and spending are more constrained. The impact of such a change on the health care economy and on most states' economy would be substantial. For example, one estimate provided in Wennberg's Dartmouth Atlas holds that if Medicare spending in regions with higher rates than Minneapolis were brought down to the level of Minneapolis (which is not even the lowest in the country), the currently-projected exhaustion of the Medicare trust fund could be avoided or substantially delayed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The huge regional variation we know exists in medical care is scientifically indefensible. When you next hear someone state that we have the finest health care system in the world, you can reasonably ask: Which one? For medical care is delivered very differently from region to region, hospital to hospital, doctor to doctor. In fact, the literature is replete with studies which show that we physicians disagree with each other and even with ourselves a high proportion of the time. Often no one knows who is right. Because of that, too often neither consumers nor health care professionals are able to make rational decisions. This is not to infer that my fellow health professionals are trying to harm people; they are not. But the fact is that they work in flawed systems with inadequate data. These flaws have to be acknowledged and fixed in a no-fault environment and adopting mechanisms and policies to do so should be a high priority effort for every state.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a speech to the American College of Surgeons, Dr. David Eddy, a noted expert, summarized our situation as follows:<br><br><em>""For centuries, the practice of medicine has been based on one huge assumption. The assumption that physicians instinctively know the right thing to do. Somehow, the assumption goes, physicians are able to assimilate all they have learned, process all the information they generate and make the right decision. That myth has been shattered. We are all coming up with different answers and it is impossible for all of us to be correct. Our practices are way out in front of our intellectual lines of supply.</em>""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is another major reason why we must deal with and correct the regional variation problem, for hundreds of billions of dollars of waste could thus be avoided and become available to provide necessary services to those currently underserved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The question of the role of supply in influencing utilization and whether more is better belongs on the national quality agenda and is an issue every state should examine and deal with.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, as part of the quality issue, there is the problem of treatment error. Because our quality control mechanisms are so rudimentary, mistakes are much more common, costly, and harmful than generally realized. There are distressingly high error rates reported in a wide range of medical practices with serious, and often fatal consequences. For example, autopsy studies show high rates (35 to 40 percent) of missed diagnoses, often resulting in death. A recent poll done by the American Medical Association suggests that more than 100 million Americans have been touched by what they consider a medical mistake, and over 40 percent of the respondents believed that these medical mistakes were misdiagnoses and wrong treatments. Dr. Lucian Leape, a physician board member of the AMA's National Patient Safety Foundation has estimated that the number of injuries caused by medical accidents in inpatient hospital settings nationwide could be as high as three million and cost as much as $200 billion a year. Conservatively, he estimates some 300,000 people die yearly as a result of medically induced injury or negligence. This is 7 times the number who die on our highways and several thousand times the annual airline fatality rate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tragedies such as these are not isolated events. The ""Harvard Medical Practice Study for the State of New York"" has demonstrated this dramatically. If the New York rates are extrapolated to the country as a whole, then the Harvard researchers estimate that over a million patients are injured in our hospitals every year, and approximately 180,000 people die each year as a result of medically induced injury or negligence. One-half of these deaths, or 90,000 each year, are considered preventable. The Harvard team concluded that medical injury and malpractice constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no other business in this country that would be allowed to continue to operate even a day with quality problems of that magnitude, nor would society pay more than a trillion dollars a year for its services. Yet this is now the case in our health care system. The executive editor of the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;has written that: ""far from being beneficial, much of the medical care in this country is unnecessary, is of no demonstrated value to those who receive it, and some of it is harmful.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are the problems consumers, health professionals, and you as purchasers and fiduciaries face. They are large, they are serious, they are growing worse, and there is no end in sight. These problems are adversely affecting you and the millions you represent and they existed long before the advent of managed care. In fact we believe that better systems of managing care are a part of our ultimate answer.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, it appears that none of the incremental approaches which state and federal governments and private sector payers are using will be powerful enough to do the job.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, where does this leave us? Where do you and we go from here? Why, given the magnitude of our problem, have we not made more progress? What lessons have we learned and might you learn from the failed debate of the past?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the lessons we have drawn is that the health care debate began before the public or even many opinion leaders, had developed anything approaching a sufficient understanding of the health care system and its problems. Now that system is changing rapidly and fundamentally in the absence of any national strategy. Yet the understanding of basic information is still lacking. The situation was well summarized by two Pulitzer Prize winners, David Broder and Haynes Johnson, in their recent book The System, which analyzes what went wrong in the recent health care debate.<br><br><em>""In the end the public got much of its informationóor misinformationófrom partisan or special-interest sourcesÖThe ability of the opposition to mobilize a small minority of people who feared losing some of their advantages carried the day. Too much of the debate was dominated by negative sound bites, by the importunings of ëspin doctors' with their misleading arguments, false analogies, and statistics crafted for the convenience of the argument, not the truth of the case. As a result, the public, for excellent reasons, was confused and frightened throughout. In a classic sense, the people were woefully uninformed. The manufactured, and manipulated, ëpublic opinion' prevailedÖWhat people really wanted to know was how the various plans would affect them and their families, and the media did not answer those questions well.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We agree and believe that necessary changes are unlikely to occur unless and until the public and leaders such as yourselves have a better understanding of the facts, and a broader and shared vision of a better, more equitable and affordable health care system, with assurance that it can be achieved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me share with you a few examples of where some better understanding is necessary. There are cities in this country that have more MRI's and cat scanners than the entire nation of Canada. In these cities, the cost of care for patients is 2-4 times higher than in other regions of the country with no better outcome. Why do we allow that to occur, why do you pay for and thus support such excess capacity?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are living in a country in which 4 out of every 100 hospitalized patients in our best hospitals experience an adverse drug reaction which increases the cost of care, injures thousands and kills many. Half of all these events are considered preventable. Why do we, why do you in state government allow this to occur? Why do you continue to pay for and tolerate such care? Why do you not insist that better systems be put in place to identify and deal with this huge, harmful and costly problem?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You all know of the recent public uproar over airline safety. Last year's TWA crash received national publicity, the President went on television, major investigations were conducted, Commissions were empaneled, and hundreds of millions of additional dollars are being poured into airline safety and security. Yet remember that, on average, fewer than 200 people die each year in airline accidents. While in the health care system, it is estimated that 180,000 patients die each year as a result of medically induced injury, and 90,000 of these deaths are considered preventable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the equivalent of 3 fully loaded jumbo jet crashes every 2 days with a total loss of life. Where is the public outrage? Do the American people and, for that matter, do you have an adequate understanding of the problem we face? We don't think so.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Achieving a common understanding requires a major educational effort. With our members' support and substantial grants from several of the nation's largest health foundations, our Coalition has dedicated itself to help create such an effort. You in each state should also consider becoming involved with us in such efforts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If we are to have a rational dialogue on health care, and ultimately achieve necessary reforms, what do we believe are some of the most important things for the public and for leaders such as you to understand?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, we believe we must all recognize this problem is not going to go away or be corrected by current approaches. It will grow worse.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, we must recognize that, for a number of reasons, market forces and competition alone will not solve our problems. Remember that markets need good information to work. Successful markets rely on a fair transaction between an informed buyer and an informed seller. That doesn't exist in health care where the consumer and often even the provider is at a severe disadvantage lacking the information necessary to make an informed decision. Consumers can't buy solely on price because they have insufficient information on quality.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Competition can help contain costs in real markets, but to get competition, you need a wide variety of choices. We're getting the exact opposite as large segments of our health care market move to more and more consolidation and therefore less competition and choice.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Markets need independent oversight to assure public accountability. There is no such mechanism to protect consumers in today's health care system. That is why 50 state legislatures and the U.S. Congress are frantically trying to patch together consumer safeguards while at the same time realizing they are not equipped to make sound scientific judgments. That necessary mechanism is yet to be created and will be a key part of the solution to the nation's problem and each state's problem.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, we all have to recognize that our problems cannot be solved by each of us acting alone or by the private sector alone or by each state acting alone. In fact our health care system, which is already the most complicated on the face of the earth and which costs 100 billion dollars each year to administer, could become an even greater nightmare if 50 states adopt 50 different and uncoordinated policies to deal with our problems. As more and more of our businesses and commerce operate across state lines, this problem becomes even more burdensome.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Federal and state governments will have to work together and develop a new private/public partnership to simplify and improve our already far too complex system.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, we believe people must understand that because our problems are interrelated, successful reform must focus on achieving five principles or goals:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Making sure every American has health insurance coverage.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Controlling total system costs and stopping cost shifting.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improving the quality of all care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creating a more viable and equitable mechanism of financing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simplifying administration.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All 5 of these principles must be achieved because you cannot solve any one of our problems without addressing them all. Let me explain. As already noted, costs are now rising at twice the rate of inflation and will double to 2 trillion dollars by 2007. A major factor increasing costs is poor quality and the resultant extensive waste and poor outcomes. Largely due to rising costs, our safety nets, including the dominant employment based health insurance system, are deteriorating causing the already large number of uninsured to increase at the rate of one million each year. We know that in the absence of insurance coverage, or cross subsidies, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get needed care. When this happens, health and, quality, in turn, suffer. In fact, the RAND authors of our Coalition's quality study assert that, other than aging, the biggest risk factors associated with a poor outcome or death are poor quality or the lack of health insurance. Because of major variations in the quality of care, where you receive care, or whether or not you do (determined largely by your insurance status) can determine whether you live or die. So, the quality, cost and coverage problems are intertwined, they exist in governmental and private sector programs and therefore cannot be successfully addressed independently. Dealing with the Medicare problem in isolation could in fact exacerbate our total system problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why do we believe these findings are relevant to the states? I think you will recognize, as does our Coalition, that such problems cannot be corrected by a consumer Bill of Rights alone, or by eliminating gag rules or by more access to specialties or better appeals processes. Far more basic steps must be taken. In order to have a high quality and less wasteful system, it will be necessary to assure that care rendered is evidence based. In our view there is no more fundamental consumer right than to be assured that care is evidence based and available to all who need it, when they need it and this, I believe every state should insist on. Absent these elements, a Bill of Rights at either the Federal or state levels will have little positive impact upon our health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, because this problem is too large and complex to be addressed by any one sector alone, we believe the nation and each state needs to proceed in partnership with the private sector in a ""no-fault"" manner to achieve the principles I have enumerated, i.e., universal coverage, containment of total system costs and development of a credible and publicly accountable quality measurement and quality assurance system. A credible arbiter will have to be part of such a system so that you as legislators are not constantly sucked into the task of making scientific decisions for which you are not trained. A national commitment to improve quality, a quality ""moonshot"" if you will, should be a major element of our national and state strategy. The payoff to society with such an effort will be huge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In summary, we know how to build a better, more affordable and higher quality system. As suggested throughout my remarks, the states have a major role to play in that process. I wish you the will and the wisdom to discern how to participate in that important effort. Thank you.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF HENRY E. SIMMONS, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P.,<br>PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE,<br>DELIVERED TO THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND QUALITY IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY<br>WASHINGTON, D.C., 11/19/97</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been asked to share our Coalition's views on the state of health care quality in America. As the nation's largest and most broadly representative health alliance, we have long been concerned with this issue. This concern is shared by all our 93 members who represent or employ over one hundred million Americans. We are non-partisan. Presidents Carter and Ford honor us as co-chairs and Governor Bob Ray, a Republican, and Congressman Paul Rogers, a Democrat, lead our effort.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe you have reason to be proud of your work in developing a Bill of Rights, but much more now needs to be done to see those rights are assured and to deal with the underlying causes of the quality problem and with the interrelated nature of the two other major health care problems we face.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me explain. Last month, our Coalition released studies on the nation's three major health care problems. They showed that the health care crisis, acknowledged by both Presidential candidates in 1992 is not only still with us, but is, in fact, growing worse and that the problems of quality, rising costs, and coverage are interrelated and therefore cannot be dealt with in isolation from each other.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In light of this we have long considered quality a central problem and a cause for deep concern. The causes of our concern have been described in our Quality report and by your many witnesses and include massive variations in medical care, millions of errors and major gaps in our knowledge and databases. You have learned that much of our technology has been adopted without adequate evaluation and that evidence to justify treatment of even the most common medical and surgical conditions is often questionable. Health professionals are working in flawed systems with inadequate data and quality controls. Studies by Harvard have concluded that medical negligence and malpractice constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic"" and because of these deficiencies and the resultant overuse, underuse and misuse of our technology, hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted, millions are injured and tens of thousands die unnecessarily each year. Quality experts say that no other industry would be allowed to operate even a day with a quality and safety record such as this. The quality problems existed long before the advent of managed care, and are found even in the nation's pre-eminent institutions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the seriousness of these problems, our nation has no integrated and adequate system for assessing or assuring quality. Currently there is no credible national quality database nor do we have in place the necessary technology and standard-setting mechanisms, which makes it very difficult for health professionals to practice as well as they would like or as well as the American people would like.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What steps are needed to bring about major improvements in the quality of our care? First, we believe we have to recognize that neither the market, or managed care or voluntary action alone nor the private sector alone will be able to correct problems of this magnitude. These problems are so large and complex that we need a&nbsp;<em>major, national</em>&nbsp;commitment-- a quality ""moonshot"" if you will, with the resources necessary to establish priorities and goals, to fund necessary research, to carry out the necessary studies, and develop necessary systems, and data. We need far more of what excellent entities such as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and some in the private sector have begun.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, the nation needs to proceed in a ""no-fault"" manner to establish a&nbsp;<em>credible</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>publicly accountable</em>&nbsp;quality measurement and assurance system and a structure and process that will bring together the strengths of the public and the private sectors, with the resources and authority necessary to do the job. We will need an arbiter and a rule setter. More detailed suggestions are contained in our Rand study and in our formal statement.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addressing our quality problems, we must constantly be aware of the interrelationships between the cost, coverage and quality problems. Costs are now rising at twice the rate of inflation and will increase 500 billion dollars in just the next five years. Today's 1 trillion-dollar system will double in cost to 2 trillion dollars in the next decade. A major factor increasing costs is poor quality and the resultant extensive waste and poor outcomes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Largely due to rising costs, our safety nets, including the employment-based health insurance system, are deteriorating, and the number of uninsured is increasing at a rate of over 1 million each year. With present trends we soon will have 80 million of our fellow citizens with no health insurance or with inadequate insurance. We know that in the absence of insurance coverage, or cross subsidies it is increasingly difficult to get needed care. The result is that health outcomes and quality suffer. In fact, Professor Robert Brook, M.D., one of the RAND authors of the Coalition's quality study asserts that other than aging, the biggest risk factor associated with a poor outcome or death is the lack of health insurance. Whether or not you receive needed care (determined largely by whether you have insurance) can determine whether you live or die. So, the quality, cost and coverage problems are intertwined and cannot be successfully addressed independently.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, in our view there is no more fundamental consumer right than to be assured that care is evidence-based, effectively delivered and available to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;who need it, when they need it. If not coupled with these elements, a Bill of Rights will not fulfill its promises or meet the public's need. In addition, costs will not be contained and the vicious cycle of increasing costs and cost shifting, decreasing coverage and resultant poor quality will continue. Without universal coverage meaningful competition will be difficult to achieve. Our health system's problems cannot be corrected without universal coverage coupled with improved quality. These are the bedrocks on which a better system must rest.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe your Commission can make a lasting contribution to the public good by insisting on and incorporating these fundamental elements as key elements of the next phase of your effort. We plan to do all we can to help make that happen. Thank you.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good morning and thank you for this, my second opportunity to address an IBEW/NECA conference on the subject of health care. My first opportunity came as the national health care debate was beginning around the President's proposal in 1991. As you know, that attempt at reform failed, and many in the small business community breathed a sigh of relief assuming their problems had been solved. Only one thing has changed since then. That is: all the problems I then described have grown worse and because of that, you and those you serve now face more serious problems than would have been the case if necessary reforms had been enacted six years ago. But more on that in a few minutes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As health fund trustees you have a special responsibility and mission: the protection of the benefits of your employees and members. As trustees and as citizens, you are also stakeholders in the nation's health care system. For both reasons and because these problems are serious, I believe you must become advocates for necessary change and reform. Otherwise, you will fail in your responsibilities to those you are entrusted to serve.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been asked to do three things today: first, to give you an update on the health system's problems; second, to describe how these problems will affect you and those who depend upon you; and third, to describe the reforms which will be necessary to address the problems. This last charge is most important because it will suggest what you can, and must do if we are to build a better, more affordable and more equitable health care system for your own families and for those you represent. In doing so, I will share with you the views of the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest and most broadly representative non-partisan alliance working to achieve necessary health system reforms.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our members include over 90 organizations, businesses large and small, ranging from giants such as Ford and Chrysler, to the 30,000 small business members of the National Community Pharmacy Association, labor unions, including our charter member the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, ably represented by Dale Dunlop, the nation's three major religious faiths, our largest consumer organizations and all of the nation's primary health care providers. Our members either represent or employ over 100 million Americans. Our honorary Co-chairs are former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford. Our Co-chairmen are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray (R-Iowa) and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers (D-Florida). We also have many prominent individual supporters including former Surgeon General Koop and Ann Landers.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now to the problems. We believe you and your beneficiaries face three serious, interrelated and growing health system problems. First, costs continue to rise at 2_ times the inflation rate and are far higher than they need to be. We spend twice as much per-capita as any other nation and yet achieve no better health outcomes. All other developed nations are providing necessary health care services to their citizens at about one half our costs and their people are as healthy, or healthier, than we, and far more satisfied with their system of care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the growth of managed care, a study we released recently, and other studies, indicate that our huge costs, already a trillion dollars yearly, will over the next five years increase 50%, rising to $1.5 trillion dollars by the year 2000. Due to a lack of purchasing leverage, you and other small businesses will be particularly hard hit with this cost escalation. In one way or another, your health funds will bear a share of those new costs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Middle-income families, those with children and incomes between $20,000 and $60,000--and that is half of all Americans--will lose the highest percent of their income due to health care inflation. This large and inequitable hidden income tax will adversely effect the standard of living and take home pay of our middle class and many of those you represent.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, major problem number one is rising cost, which has risen by over 330 billion dollars since reform efforts foundered just a few short years ago.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rising costs, in turn, lead us to our second major problem which is decreasing health insurance coverage. We are already at a point where almost 80 million Americans--that's one in three people under 65--are either totally uninsured or underinsured--this is 10 million more than when the health care debate began only six short years ago. In large part, due to rising costs one million more Americans are being added to the ranks of the uninsured each year and many of these are from working middle class families. Because of cost increases, more contingent workers are hired and fewer and fewer employees are provided with health insurance coverage. In fact, the fastest growing segments of our economy are small businesses in the service sector, and fewer and fewer of these jobs come with health insurance coverage.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of rising costs and other economic forces, our present dominant employment based health insurance system is deteriorating. And since we have nothing ready to replace it, the number of uninsured and underinsured will inevitably grow. The growing burden of covering the uninsured will be transferred even more to groups such as yours, to the NECA's and IBEW's of the world.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a classic example of the systemic and interrelated nature of the problems we face and how they disproportionately hit private payers - especially small business payers such as yourselves. As costs increase, more and more businesses and governments, federal and state, have to cut coverage. As government's health care subsidies are cut back and the larger private sector payers with leverage try to pay less, the costs of the uninsured are shifted to private sector payers such as yourselves, and you in small businesses are hit far harder than your large business brethren. So, you pay twice, once for rising costs and then for your disproportionate share of a larger and larger cost shift. In the absence of major reforms, this cost shift to you is inevitable and will grow. In addition, because of your higher employment costs, you will become less and less competitive as you bid against competitors who do not provide or who cut back on coverage.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The worrisome thing is that this cutback in employer based coverage is occurring in spite of the best economic times in our history, questioning the views of those who claim a rising economy will grow us out of our problem. Just imagine what will happen to the number of uninsured and to the magnitude of cost shifting when we experience the next economic downturn.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given our cost problem, it is understandable why government and private sector payers, such as you, are focusing on cost control. But that then compounds our third problem, the quality of our care. We should all be concerned that despite the close relationship between cost and quality, and the known difficulty in containing costs if quality is poor, to this point, the health care debate and your efforts have focused almost exclusively on cost issues. This has led to efforts by government and the private sector to control costs, predominantly by limiting fees, increasing beneficiary cost sharing, and increasing the use of managed care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, a large and growing body of evidence raises questions as to whether any or all of these approaches will, over the long term, contain costs. For the evidence shows that the major driver of rapidly rising cost is increasing intensity of care and a sharp increase in our use of technology, especially for care of the growing number of elderly. This fact raises the critical question: Just how good is the quality of our care and what do we health professionals and you, the payers and consumers, know about this technology?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Indications are we don't know nearly enough. There are major gaps in our knowledge base which contribute to medical uncertainty. Much of our medical technology has been adopted and widely utilized without adequate evaluation. The evidence to justify treatment of even the most common medical and surgical conditions is often questionable. This includes such common conditions as prostate cancer and low back pain, which affects millions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, there is no credible national database on quality and no national technology assessment or standard setting mechanism. This makes it very difficult for health professionals to practice as well as they would like or as well as you would like.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Medical uncertainty leads to enormous regional variations in health care with no evidence that people in regions with access to more care have better outcomes than people in regions with less care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such huge variation is scientifically indefensible. When you next hear someone state that we have the finest health care system in the world, you can reasonably ask: Which one? For medical care is delivered substantially differently from region to region, hospital to hospital, doctor to doctor. In fact, the literature is replete with studies that show that we physicians disagree with each other and even with ourselves a high proportion of the time. Often no one knows who is right. Because of that, too often neither consumers nor health care professionals are able to make rational decisions. This is not to infer that my fellow health professionals are trying to harm people; they are not. But the fact is that they work in flawed systems. These flaws have to be acknowledged and fixed in a no-fault environment.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a speech to the American College of Surgeons, Dr. David Eddy, a noted expert, summarized our situation as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>""For centuries, the practice of medicine has been based on one huge assumption. The assumption that physicians instinctively know the right thing to do. Somehow, the assumption goes, physicians are able to assimilate all they have learned, process all the information they generate and make the right decision. That myth has been shattered. We are all coming up with different answers and it is impossible for all of us to be correct. Our practices are way out in front of our intellectual lines of supply.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, there is the problem of treatment error. Because our quality control mechanisms are so rudimentary, mistakes are much more common, costly, and harmful than generally realized. There are distressingly high error rates reported in a wide range of medical practices with serious, and sometimes fatal consequences. For example, autopsy studies show high rates (35 to 40 percent) of missed diagnoses, often resulting in death.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tragedies such as these are not isolated events. The ""Harvard Medical Practice Study in the State of New York"" has demonstrated this dramatically. If the New York rates can be extrapolated to the country as a whole, then the Harvard researchers estimate that over a million patients are injured in our hospitals every year, and approximately 180,000 people die each year as a result of medically induced injury or negligence. One-half of these deaths, or 90,000 each year, are considered preventable. The Harvard team concluded that medical injury and malpractice constitute the nation's ""hidden epidemic.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no other business or industry in this country, including yours, that would be allowed to continue to operate even a day with quality problems of that magnitude, nor would society pay almost a trillion dollars a year for its services. Yet this is now the case in today's health care system. The executive editor of the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;has written that: ""far from being beneficial, much of the medical care in this country is unnecessary, is of no demonstrated value to those who receive it, and some of it is harmful.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are the problems health professionals, you purchasers and consumers face. They are large, they are serious, they are growing worse, and there is no end in sight. These problems are already affecting you and the tens of thousands of employees you represent.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, it appears that none of the incremental approaches government and private sector payers such as yourselves are using will be powerful enough to do the job. This includes prevention, beneficiary cost sharing, cost shifting or managed care, where we are already seeing a significant increase in premiums with more predicted to come. The huge public and congressional backlash against managed care is going to make it much more difficult to capture further managed care efficiencies and savings or even to preserve the ones we have gained.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, we already have evidence that incremental fixes can ultimately and inadvertently make a bad situation worse. Why is it, then, we keep hearing about step-by-step reform and that Congress, this session, seemed to have its health care mandate of the day? Well, it is natural, I think, in the face of an overwhelming and complicated crisis, to look for something simple you can do to solve at least a piece of the puzzle. The thinking goes: ""doing something is better than doing nothing at all."" Unfortunately, on close scrutiny, the incremental fix may have unintended consequences. Let me give you two examples.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Last year, on the eve of her departure from the Congress, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, along with Senator Kennedy, to their credit, succeeded in winning congressional passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, frequently described as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill or the HIPAA bill. President Clinton and many in Congress hailed this legislation as one of the most significant reform measures in recent memory.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For many, the bill's reforms - addressing pre-existing limitations, guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability - opened new job opportunities. Now, when a worker goes from one group insurance plan to another, his new plan may not deny him coverage based on a pre-existing condition. But what happens when he leaves a group health insurance plan to join an employer with no insurance, or when he decides to become self-employed? Under the law, he'll be guaranteed access to two or more individual policies whose premiums he'll have to pay. But the law allows the premiums charged to be ""actuarially fairly"" priced. As noted financial columnist Jane Bryant Quinn said in a column last September,&nbsp;<em>""Family coverage normally costs about $4,000 to $5,000, and the price could be double if you have a medical problem. If the average worker had that kind of money, there wouldn't be 40 million people uninsured.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the unintended consequence? Many American workers might have believed that they could take the insurance they now have wherever they go. But it's not true. And for those workers who thought insurance might become more affordable, wrong again. Further, the law only applies to transition from group insurance to another group or from group to individual insurance. If you want to switch from one individual policy to another, you're out of luck. And finally, if you're currently uninsured, you're no longer better off under HIPAA than you are now. In addition the bill has in it provisions and new reporting requirements that could become an administrative nightmare for payers, providers and beneficiaries, adding new costs that could wipe out any advantages obtained, while the basic problems of cost, quality and coverage remain.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are other examples of well-intentioned legislation that may have unintended consequences. Congress included a demonstration program for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Advocates believe MSAs will empower consumers and foster a competitive climate. But not everyone is guaranteed to win.<br><br>According to Gail Shearer, Director, Health Policy Analysis at Consumers Union:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>""Economists predict that premiums for traditional health insurance (which typically charges $250 up front as deductible) will increase by as much as 300% if MSAs are allowed without limits into the health insurance market. What this would mean for consumers is less choice, when traditional policies become unaffordable or are possibly driven out of the market altogether. MSAs are not the solution for the 10 million uninsured children, whose parents cannot afford health care if they face a steep deductible. If introduced into Medicare, they threaten to siphon off billions of dollars to help the healthy get wealthy, leaving depleted funds to care for the sick.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So these incremental approaches can fall far short of their promises and fail to address the major problem of rising costs, the uninsured or the quality problems. It seems to us that most of these measures, no matter how well intended and offered in good faith, fail to adequately deal with the very large problems I have laid before you today.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, where does this leave us? Where do we and you go from here? Our Coalition is convinced these problems will not self correct or be successfully patched by partial reforms. They will require major national policy changes and a new public/private partnership. How will this be done? Why, given the magnitude of our problem, have we not made more progress? What lessons have we learned and might you learn from the failed debate of the past?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the lessons we have drawn is that the health care debate began before the public or even many opinion leaders, possibly many of you in this room, had developed anything approaching a sufficient understanding of the working of the health care system. Now that system is changing rapidly and fundamentally in the absence of any national strategy. Yet the understanding of basic information is still lacking. The situation was well summarized by David Broder and Haynes Johnson in their recent book&nbsp;<em>The System</em>, which analyzes what went wrong in the health care debate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>""In the end the public got much of its information-or misinformation-from partisan or special-interest sourcesŠThe ability of the opposition to mobilize a small minority of people who feared losing some of their advantages carried the day. Too much of the debate was dominated by negative sound bites, by the importunings of 'spin doctors' with their misleading arguments, false analogies, and statistics crafted for the convenience of the argument, not the truth of the case. As a result, the public, for excellent reasons, was confused and frightened throughout. In a classic sense, the people were woefully uninformed. The manufactured, and manipulated, 'public opinion' prevailedŠWhat people really wanted to know was how the various plans would affect them and their families, and the media did not answer those questions well.""</em><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We agree and believe that necessary changes are unlikely to occur unless and until the people and opinion leaders such as yourselves and policy makers have a better understanding of the facts, and a broader and shared vision of a better, more equitable and affordable health care system, with assurance that it can be achieved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let me share with you a few examples of where some better understanding is necessary. There are cities in this country which have more MRI's and cat scanners than the nation of Canada. In these locations, the cost of care for patients is 2-4 times higher than in any other region of the country with no better outcome. Why do we allow that to occur?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are living in a country in which 4 out of every 100 hospitalized patients in our best hospitals experience an adverse drug reaction which increases the cost of care, injures thousands and kills many. Half of all these events are considered preventable. Why do we, why do you allow this to occur?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You all know of the recent public uproar over airline safety. Last year's TWA crash received national publicity, the President went on television, major investigations were conducted, Commissions were empaneled, and hundreds of millions of additional dollars are being poured into airline safety and security. Yet remember that on average, less than 200 people die each year in airline accidents. While in the health care system, it is estimated that 180,000 patients die each year as a result of medically induced injury, and 90,000 of these deaths are considered preventable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the equivalent of 3 fully loaded jumbo jet crashes every 2 days with a total loss of life. Where is the public outrage? Do the American people and, for that matter, do you and our policy makers have an adequate understanding of the problem we face? We don't think so.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are just a few examples of where a common base of understanding coupled with effective corrective action is necessary. Achieving a common understanding requires a major educational effort. With our members' support and substantial grants from several of the nation's largest health foundations, our Coalition has dedicated itself to help create such an effort. If we are to have a rational dialogue on health care, what do we believe are some of the most important things for the public and for leaders such as you to understand?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, we believe we must all recognize this problem is not going to go away. It will grow worse. It is far larger than Medicare and dealing with the Medicare problem in isolation, which is what Congress has proposed, merely shifts the problem and massive costs from government's ledger to the private sector leaving our basic problem un-addressed. This is the strategy the nation has pursued for 30 years, and it has not and will not work. We need system-wide change and we need it now.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second, we must recognize that, for a number of reasons, market forces and competition alone will not solve our problems. Remember that markets need good information to work. It requires a fair transaction between an informed buyer and an informed seller. That doesn't exist in health care where the consumer and often even the provider is at a severe disadvantage lacking the information necessary to make an informed decision. Consumers can't buy solely on price because they have insufficient information on quality.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Competition can help contain costs in real markets, but to get competition, you need a wide variety of choices. We're getting the exact opposite as large segments of our health care market continues to move towards consolidation. (e.g. Minneapolis-St. Paul.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other markets, including airlines and the financial markets, have independent oversight to assure public accountability. There is no such mechanism to protect consumers in today's health care system. That is why 50 state legislatures and the U.S. Congress are frantically trying to patch together consumer safeguards while at the same time realizing they are not equipped to make sound scientific judgments. That necessary mechanism is yet to be created and will be a key part of the solution of our problem.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Third, we all have to recognize that our problems cannot be solved by each of us acting alone or by the private sector alone or by NECA/IBEW alone. Government will have to have a role and together we need to develop a new public, private partnership.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, we believe people must understand that because these problems are interrelated, successful reform must focus on achieving five goals:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Making sure every American has health insurance coverage.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In summary: We recognize that none of these necessary reforms is likely to occur unless and until more Americans and opinion leaders and decision makers such as yourselves understand the facts and insist that fundamental reforms be enacted, reforms which will assure attainment of the key principles I have described.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This will require a major national educational and advocacy campaign. Our Coalition members have committed themselves to such an effort which is described in more detail in your handouts. IBEW is already a key participant in that campaign. Since they and you face common problems, we are hopeful NECA will also see merit in our effort and join us in working toward our mutual goal of a better, more affordable and more equitable health care system. As I said at the outset, I hope you will accept the challenge of joining in this campaign and working with other key groups to help obtain reforms which will ultimately benefit us all. I hope the facts have convinced you that you in small businesses and your employees will benefit greatly if we succeed and suffer disproportionately if we fail. The choice is yours either way. We welcome your help.</p>

473,"Some Cause for Optimism in the President’s Budget","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While there is still plenty to argue about in the President’s proposal, the new budget does back several common-ground initiatives to curb health care costs that have been previously endorsed by key Republican lawmakers.&nbsp;Now the question is whether Congress can take yes for an answer and do something about the rising cost of health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SGR Reform and Physician Payment Reform:</strong>&nbsp;The President’s budget applauds last year’s bipartisan, bicameral legislation to repeal the SGR and promote new alternative payment models,&nbsp;and echoes calls from top Republican committee chairmen to finish the job this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Episodic bundling and PAC reforms:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The budget embraces episodic bundling initiatives similar to proposals advanced by Republican lawmakers that would encourage providers to deliver the right care at the most affordable cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health Care Price and Quality Transparency:</strong>&nbsp; The budget backs new data transparency reforms—similar to those championed by Representative Paul Ryan and Senator John Thune—that would enable consumer transparency tools to draw on Medicare’s storehouse of quality and cost data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sequester Relief:</strong>&nbsp; The budget ends blunt-force sequestration cuts to tobacco prevention, diabetes prevention, and medical and nursing education—all programs that are vital to taming cost growth over the long-term. These cuts are replaced by hundreds of billions of savings through more targeted&nbsp;proposals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The budget includes less helpful ideas as well.&nbsp;Administration proposals to dial up means testing and increase Medicare Part&nbsp; B deductibles merely shift costs to beneficiaries. Such proposals may have some bipartisan support, but they do nothing to address the waste and inefficiency that are driving health care costs.&nbsp;When there are billions in real efficiencies to be found through constructive policy change, cost-shifting to seniors and the disabled is not the right way to achieve savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, we now know that SGR reform, improving value in Medicare, transparency, and sequester relief&nbsp;are on the to-do lists of both the Administration and key Republicans.&nbsp;Maybe, just maybe, that could mean a little relief&nbsp;from the rising burden of&nbsp; health care costs is achievable this Congress.”</p>

<p><em>Statement from National Coalition on Health Care President and CEO John Rother on&nbsp;</em><em>President Barack Obama’s 2015 budget.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Credit is due to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees for piloting this bill through today’s treacherous health care politics. Let’s hope yesterday’s signing of the IMPACT Act of 2014 is only the first, not the last, health policy win to emerge from bipartisan, bicameral efforts this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new law will enable physicians, hospitals, and post-acute providers to better track and improve care for beneficiaries after a hospital stay by requiring providers to submit patient assessment data in a standardized format, and by developing systems of measurement for clinical quality, outcomes and resource use that can be applied across all post-acute settings.&nbsp;With this information, payers, providers, consumers, and family caregivers can work together to identify the best care setting for each individual.&nbsp;And policymakers can begin the challenging work of bringing broader reform to Medicare’s post-acute care systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope Congress will soon repeat this bipartisan, bicameral success in the areas of SGR reform, transparency, and care coordination. If they don’t, we will continue to see unchecked health costs erode the prosperity of American families and businesses.”</p>

<p>Safety Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access (SNHPA) has joined the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP), a broad-based coalition concerned about the skyrocketing cost of prescription medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“SNHPA will bring a much needed perspective and make a valuable contribution to the effort to find sensible solutions to irrational prescription drug prices, especially those for new specialty drugs,” says John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), which heads up CSRxP. “We need&nbsp;to move to an approach where drug pricing is based on value to the health care system. New medicines offer extraordinary promise, but we are concerned that the system that has brought us these advances will become unsustainable if we can’t find a way to bring greater rationality to prices.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SNHPA represents more than 1,000 hospitals that participate in the federal 340B drug discount program. The 340B program requires drug manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals at a discount to public and private non-profit hospitals that serve high volumes of low-income patients. These hospitals provide over $28 billion in uncompensated care every year. The savings they realize from 340B drug discounts enable them to expand and improve care for their vulnerable patient populations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hospitals and clinics in the 340B program must care for all patients whether they can pay or not,” says SNHPA President and Chief Executive Officer Ted Slafsky. “Today, on average, 340B hospitals are either squeaking by on historically slim operating margins – around 2 percent – or they are in the red. Major drug manufacturers’ profit margins average more than 20 percent.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Slafsky noted the significant growth in the specialty drug market. “While many of these medications offer great promise, the price tag for health care providers and patients is simply unsustainable. Even at a discount, our hospitals and patients are struggling to afford medications that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. We look forward to working with the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing to address these challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>America's Health Care: At a Critical Crossroads</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The nation's health care system is in need of serious repair. Health care spending is rising more than double the rate of inflation. Millions of Americans are uninsured. Millions more who have health insurance currently worry they will not be able to afford it when they lose or leave their jobs. Today, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured are from families where someone is employed full- or part-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, serious questions have been raised about the quality of care and the efficiency with which care is delivered. Our nation surpasses other developed nations in technology, yet the health status of our people has not proportionally improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America's health care stands at a critical crossroads. It is time we, as a nation, make an informed decision about where to go from here. A sustained, vigorous health care dialogue requires honest communication and consensus. Since health care involves individuals and families, businesses, big and small, and state and federal governments, the future of the nationís health depends on the outcome of that dialogue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Speaking With One Voice</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Escalating health care costs affect all of us in federal and state government, the private sector and American families. Individuals and families particularly are feeling the strain of shouldering more of the health costs directly. For many, their take-home pay grows more slowly and their standard of living stagnates. There seems to be no reassuring end in sight. These health care concerns affect all people regardless of political, generational, economic, gender or ethnic boundaries. America's strained health care system is everyone's concern, and we must all make it a priority to bring high quality, affordable and accessible health care into the national agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To that end, the National Coalition on Health Care has established a powerful, non-partisan effort to build understanding of the magnitude of the problem in quality of care, rising costs and decreasing coverage. In our quest to assure America's health, there are no single vested interests, only collective concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Setting the Nation's Agenda for Action</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supported by its members and generous grants from the W.K. Kellogg, Henry J. Kaiser Family and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations, the Coalition has launched a multi-year education campaign on the realities and challenges of the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is our role in ensuring that any change in the system addresses the interrelated problems of quality, cost and access for both the government and the private sector? How can we safeguard our health care delivery and quality of care? How are government, industry and the American family coping? What is happening in the world of insurance coverage? How rapidly is the cost of health care rising? How vulnerable are special populations from the very young to the very old? How difficult is it for people with physical and economic challenges to obtain health care?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the Coalition's leadership, this national dialogue will take place in big cities and small towns across the country through:</p>

<p>Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid is a serious problem in America’s health care system. Improper payments currently cost our government $70 billion per year. Congressional action is needed to eliminate improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid. We must increase our investment in fraud prevention and enforcement programs and increase penalties, without impeding the delivery of health care services to beneficiaries. &nbsp;The FAST Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Thomas Carper and Sen. Thomas Coburn, includes essential policy changes to help combat fraud.</p>

640,"<strong>America's Health Care: At a Critical Crossroads</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The nation's health care system is in need of serious repair. Health care spending is rising more than double the rate of inflation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Millions of Americans are uninsured. Millions more who have health insurance currently worry they won't be able to afford it when they lose or leave their jobs. Today, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured are from families where someone is employed full- or part-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, serious questions have been raised about the quality of care and the efficiency with which care is delivered. Our nation surpasses other developed nations in technology, yet the health status of our people has not proportionally improved. The quality of health care is being brought into question by distressingly high error rates in diagnosis and treatment. Consumers fear that quality health care has been compromised, costs are rising and coverage decreasing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; America's health care stands at a critical crossroads. It's time we, as a nation, make an informed decision about where to go from here. Important trends, such as serious problems in quality, continued escalation of costs and increases in the number of uninsured Americans highlight the need for renewed discussion and workable solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sustained, vigorous health care dialogue requires honest communication and consensus. Since health care involves individuals and families, businesses, big and small, and state and federal governments, the future of the nation's health is at stake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Speaking with One Voice</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Escalating health care costs impact all of us-the federal government, the private sector and American families. Individuals and families particularly are feeling the strain of shouldering more of the health costs directly. For many, their take-home pay grows more slowly and their standard of living stagnates. There seems to be no reassuring end in sight. These health care concerns affect all people regardless of political, generational, economic, gender or ethnic boundaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; America's strained health care system is everyone's concern and we must all make it a priority to bring high quality, affordable and accessible health care into the national agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To that end, the National Coalition on Health Care has established a powerful, nonpartisan effort to build understanding of the magnitude of the problem in quality of care, rising costs and decreasing coverage. In our quest ""for America's health,"" there are no single vested interests, only collective concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The National Coalition on Health Care is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care. Almost 100 leadership organizations, representing 100 million Americans, have joined this nonpartisan effort. As diverse as these groups are, they stand united in finding a solution to assure quality, contain costs, maintain access, and encourage choice in a competitive marketplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Counted among the Coalition's members are large and small businesses, labor unions, religious groups, consumer advocates, insurers and the nation's primary care providers and academic health centers. Some of the nation's most distinguished leaders from academia, business and government have also pledged their support of the Coalition's efforts. And we're honored that two of the nation's former Presidents from both sides of the political spectrum have come together to serve as honorary co-chairs, elevating this issue beyond politics as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Setting the Nation's Agenda for Action</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supported by its members and generous grants from the W.K. Kellogg, Henry J. Kaiser Family and Robert Wood Johnson foundations, the Coalition has launched a multi-year education campaign on the realities and challenges of the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is our role in ensuring that any change in the system addresses the interrelated problems of quality, cost and access f or both government and the private sector? How can we safeguard our health care delivery and quality of care? How are government, industry and the American family coping? What is happening in the world of insurance coverage and employer-based coverage? Is the cost of health care rising or falling? How vulnerable are special populations from the very young to the very old? How difficult is it for people with physical and economic challenges?</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the Coalition's leadership, this national dialogue will take place in big cities and small towns across the country through:</p>

641,"<strong>Health Care Forum on Business Strategies</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the 1992-94 health reform debate, the National Coalition on Health Care concluded that public education was a vital ingredient missing from the national dialogue on health care reform. The Coalition responded by developing a program designed fo r senior business leaders in Atlanta, GA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, Boston, MA, and Chicago, IL, in a series of Fall 1995 forums. These colloquia, co-sponsored and funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, addressed the issues of cost containmen t, quality care, and consolidation within the health care delivery system at the national, regional and local levels. The morning session focused on private sector issues and cost containment strategies used by local business leaders. The afternoon sess ion examined the rapidly changing landscape in the local health care delivery systems, featuring representatives from local HMOs and hospital networks. The session concluded with a discussion of the increasingly serious issue of quality health care and o utcomes research. To attract an audience comprised of CEOs, CFOs, senior vice presidents for compensation and benefits, and directors of human resources, the Coalition worked cooperatively with the Pacific Business Group on Health, the New York Business Group on Health, Northeastern University’s College of Business Administration, the Midwest Business Group on Health, and with Coalition members Southern California Edison Company and R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company. The conferences were standing-room-only, with a total of 1,200 participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The overwhelming response was due in part to the caliber of speakers who the Coalition attracted, including President Jimmy Carter, Fran Bastien of Digital Equipment Corporation, Dr. Chris Bisgard of Delta Airlines, Lawrence English of CIGNA HealthCare, Mark Goldberg of the Yale School of Management, Fred Hamacher and Ed Wingate of Dayton Hudson Corporation, Margaret Jordan of Southern California Edison Company, Dr. Lucian Leape of the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. David Lawrence of Kaiser Foundat ion Health Plan, Inc., Dr. George Lundberg of the Journal of American Medical Association, Dr. Arnold Milstein of the Pacific Business Group on Health, Susan Moriconi of Hewlett-Packard Company, Dr. Richard Nesson of Partners HealthCare System, Inc., Char lie Pryde of the Ford Motor Company, Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University, Dr. Steven Schroeder of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Dr. David Skinner of The New York Hospital and Dr. John Wennberg of the Dartmouth Medical School.<strong>1998 Executive Business Series:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than forty CEO’s of major national corporations and local businesses attended Executive Briefings on Health Care conducted by the Coalition in Denver and Des Moines this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coalition developed the Executive Briefing Series in response to feedback from previous conferences. The sessions were structured to focus beyond the immediate cost issues surrounding the provision of health care benefits to include a broader unde rstanding of the meaningful role that business has in determining the nation’s future health care environment.</p>

Attendees included CEO’s, Chairmen, Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents who gathered at the University of Denve r’s Phipps Mansion for a four-hour session on March 31<sup>st</sup>. The meeting began with welcoming remarks by&nbsp;<strong>James D. Griesemer, Ph.D.,&nbsp;</strong>Dean of the Daniels College of Business, and&nbsp;<strong>Abe Kauvar, M.D.,</strong>&nbsp;Founder and President of the Kauvar F oundation. The session was facilitated by&nbsp;<strong>Michael Maccoby</strong>, President, Maccoby Consulting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants voiced concern about rising health care costs, a lack of public understanding of health care as a ""system,"" a need for universal insurance coverage and a common definition of health care quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Henry Simmons</strong>, the Coalition’s President, provided the group with an overview of the current state of the health care system. During the luncheon,&nbsp;<strong>Kenneth Thorpe, Ph.D.,</strong>&nbsp;of Tulane University explained the rising costs of health care and the implications for business.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(NAPS)-If you have a concern about the quality of our nation's health care system, you are not alone.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A nationally projectable poll of American households reflects a lack of consumer confidence among the majority of Americans in the quality, cost and accessibility of medical care and the health care system overall. The poll,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/perceive/"">How Americans Perceive the Health Care System</a>, commissioned by the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest health care alliance, highlights the most pressing health care concerns that face American families today and reveals deep concern among Americans with the current state of our health care system.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simply put, the poll illustrates that the majority of Americans have lost confidence in the health care system's ability to care for people. Eight out of ten respondents believe there is something seriously wrong with our health care system. In addition, six out of ten are not optimistic about the future of health care and seven out of ten agree that there are serious problems with the quality of care and that the quality of care is often compromised to save money.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cost of medical care is also a significant issue to those polled. Eight out of ten respondents believe quality health care is almost unaffordable for the average person.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contrary to the widely publicized view that government should not be involved in health care, the survey indicates a bipartisan majority of Americans feel the federal government should play an active role in working with the private sector to improve the quality of health care.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the growing concern with the direction of our health care system, half of the adult population feels that their individual medical plan provides quality care. In general, people over sixty-five years of age are more satisfied with the quality and coverage than those in their thirties and forties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The National Coalition on Health Care</em>&nbsp;is an alliance of almost 100 organizations, employing or representing approximately 100 millions Americans, united in the belief that we can achieve better more affordable health care for all Americans.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John Rother, President &amp; CEO and Larry McNeely, Policy Director</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although we lack a full&nbsp;Congressional Budget Office(CBO) analysis, the House budget reconciliation package appears to fall short with respect to NCHC’s central priority, improving health care affordability. We&nbsp;are also &nbsp;concerned the bill would shift costs now born by the federal government onto consumers and state taxpayers. It is time for this Congress to begin considering a different approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a series of blog posts on NCHC’s website in the summer of 2016, we expressed our hope that certain concepts in the House Republican Conference’s health care blueprint,&nbsp;<em>A Better Way,</em>&nbsp;could serve as the basis for serious discussion and common ground. We singled out that document’s support for&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-in-a-better-way-to-fix-health-care/"">value-based insurance design</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-part-2/"">pre-existing condition protections, and state innovation funds</a>&nbsp;as constructive. Yet we also took&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-in-a-better-way-part-3/"">strong exception</a>&nbsp;to policies that merely moved costs borne by the federal government onto consumers or taxpayers at the state level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the release and accelerated markup of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), we have now seen the 115<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Congress’ first effort to translate&nbsp;<em>A Better Way</em>&nbsp;into legislation. Regrettably, preliminary analyses from outside research organizations, ranging from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1811131&amp;SctArtId=418648&amp;from=CM&amp;nsl_code=LIME&amp;sourceObjectId=10006958&amp;sourceRevId=3&amp;fee_ind=N&amp;exp_date=20270307-22:26:18"">Standard &amp; Poors</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-affordable-care-act-repeal-and-replace-plans-might-shift-health-insurance-tax-credits/"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, indicate that the AHCA would have significant negative effects on affordability and coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We continue to consult with our member organizations regarding the legislation. Once a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis is released, we expect to react to its central provisions, including its Medicaid and tax credit sections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even without a publicly available CBO score, serious problems are apparent. These flaws undercut its authors’ own stated goals of minimizing disruption to Americans’ current coverage during a transition period and empowering states to lower costs and improve care. Indeed, aspects of the bill could do serious and immediate harm- even before the broader Medicaid per capita allotment and tax credit provisions take effect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our early analysis has identified specific provisions that would:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Threaten the stability of non-group insurance markets:&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ways and Means Budget Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations immediately zero out the penalty for failing to meet current law’s individual responsibility requirement. Yet the proposed State Patient and Stability Fund, established to stabilize the market, is scheduled to go into effect in 2018. That deadline may prove challenging to meet operationally. And any mismatch between the individual responsibility requirement repeal and the availability of state stabilization funds could destabilize non-group insurance markets. This effect will only be exacerbated by continuing uncertainty around the availability of cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments for 2018 and 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decimate chronic disease prevention efforts: Section 101 of the Energy and Commerce Budget&nbsp; Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations immediately eliminates the Public Health and Prevention Fund without making any provision to replace those dollars through Congressionally-directed spending. A funding cut of this magnitude not only eliminates 12% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget; it threatens $625 million a year in support for innovative state and local initiatives to fight preventable chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undermine Medicare Financing:&nbsp; As called for in the W&amp;M Recommendations, the immediate repeal of the 0.9% Medicare Hospital Insurance payroll tax is estimated to accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund forward to 2025-absent offsetting revenues. This manufactured crisis could be used by a future Congress as a pretext to impose blunt provider, health plan or beneficiary cuts in Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defund state Medicaid expansion coverage for the working poor:&nbsp; Section 112 of the E&amp;C Recommendations would maintain enhanced federal support (E-FMAP) for Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled as of Jan 31, 2019. However, if a beneficiary has any break in Medicaid coverage of a month or more, the enhanced E-FMAP would be terminated. This encourages states to drop from coverage any childless adult who secures a job paying more than the Federal Poverty Level (just $1005 per month for a single individual in 2017). In itself, this is a work disincentive. Additionally, Section 116 incentivizes state officials to audit their circumstances and earnings to ensure that they are eligible. The interaction of these provisions would immediately begin reducing Medicaid expansion and significantly limit states’ flexibility to support employment and cover the working poor through Medicaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time for Congress to consider an entirely different tack. Congressional leaders should set aside sweeping overhauls of the health sector and return to a more step-by-step approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For our part, the National Coalition on Health Care has come together around several nonpartisan policy objectives, which could inform the development of a constructive agenda:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stabilize the non-group health insurance markets, by maintaining cost-sharing reductions and tax credits, avoiding disruption of current Medicaid funding and providing ongoing risk stabilization support</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bring down the cost of care in Medicare and the private sector by improving chronic illness care, further accelerating the transition away from fee-for-service, and embracing value-based insurance design</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand primary care, prevention and other interventions that improve outcomes and reduce downstream medical costs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Extend the state-based Children’s Health Insurance Program(CHIP) and bolster funding for the nation’s network of community health centers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Tackle the high cost of prescription drugs through market-based solutions: transparency, value, and competition</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is much that is broken in American health care. To have hope of fixing these problems, this Congress and Administration will have to act. Unfortunately, we fear that the legislative language advanced this week could make Americans’ health care affordability problems worse, not better.</p>

<p><strong>Congress Should Move Promptly on Three Key MedPAC Recommendations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by John Rother, President and CEO of the&nbsp;</em><em>National Coalition on Health Care</em><em>, on the release of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s (MedPAC) June 2012 Report to Congress.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“MedPAC has offered up three powerful policy tools to curb costs and improve quality in Medicare. Congress should not hesitate to put those tools to work.First, as part of a broader benefit redesign, MedPAC proposes giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the ability to vary copays for various treatments based on evidence of their value.&nbsp; This would allow implementation in Medicare of the value-based insurance design innovations that have yielded substantial savings in the private sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, the Commission also proposes a sequence of policy measures intended to give more beneficiaries access to the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)- an approach that offers&nbsp; high-quality, well-coordinated care, structured around a day health center while enabling frail elders to stay in their homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the report’s chapter on care coordination, though lacking a formal recommendation, clearly points toward consideration of immediate measures to improve care coordination for fee for service beneficiaries, such as a per member coordination payment or penalties for poor outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As MedPAC notes, Medicare is already poised to test a range of innovative new models of care in coming years. However, as promising as these pilots may be over the long-term, they only enroll a fraction of beneficiaries today and will take years to develop fully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, Congress could act now to implement value based insurance design, expand PACE, and improve care coordination.&nbsp; As Medicare costs continue to grow, beneficiaries should not have to wait for lower-cost, higher-quality care.”</p>

In contrast, Congress could act now to implement value based insurance design, expand PACE, and improve care coordination.&nbsp; As Medicare costs continue to grow, beneficiaries should not have to wait for lower-cost, higher-quality care.</p>

<p><em>by Larry McNeely</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Senate’s decision to take up&nbsp;the Fiscal Year 2017 budget resolution, Congressional leaders are now pursuing repeal of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act without an immediate replacement. It is time that we took a hard look at this strategy’s implications for health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the outset, I should stipulate that this course of action is not one NCHC can support. Despite real flaws in the ACA and pressing affordability challenges, the United States&nbsp;has&nbsp;managed to end pre-existing condition denials and benefit caps, cover more Americans and slow the growth in Medicare spending. In our view, this Congress ought to be working together, on a bipartisan basis, to fix what’s broken in our health system without first putting these broadly supported achievements at risk…now or in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, this post is not a polemic against repeal. Instead, I want to invite ACA supporters and opponents alike to examine a very specific aspect of forthcoming repeal legislation….the replacement fund, established by Section 3002 of the budget resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This “fund” may seem like an arcane detail in the budget process, but exactly how Congress handles this issue will substantially impact the lives of ordinary Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You see, ending the ACA’s major coverage provisions such as the affordability tax credits, the Medicaid expansion or the individual and employer mandates, will produce savings to the federal treasury. Although much of these savings are expected to offset the rollback or delay of taxes which helped pay&nbsp;for the ACA, the budget resolution provides that all but $2 billion of the&nbsp;<em>net</em>&nbsp;savings from any repeal bill would be set aside in this fund to cover the cost of eventual replacement legislation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s say the eventual repeal bill sunsets key coverage provisions after two years and allocates the savings to this replacement fund. &nbsp;How much would go into this fund?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HR 3762, the vetoed repeal bill from 2015 which today’s Congressional leaders are using as a template, produced $317.5 billion in net savings, or $516 billion when accounting for macroeconomic effects,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/costestimate/hr3762followingenactmentofconsolidatedappropsactof2016.pdf"">according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office</a>. (We will not know the exact impact of this year’s legislation until CBO scores an actual bill specifying the provisions to be repealed and the date of their repeal, but using the HR 3762 numbers should give us a rough approximation of what this year’s repeal effort&nbsp;might generate.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem is that $300-500 billion is only a fraction of the $1.4 trillion in direct ACA coverage spending which is expected to be repealed. Even if our lawmakers were given the judgment and wisdom of Solomon, it would not be possible to cover the same number of people at one third of the cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No efficiencies, newly wrung from the health system, can be sufficient to make up a budgetary difference of that magnitude. Lawmakers will be forced to turn to some combination of the following blunt force cuts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reducing the size of the tax credit available for private coverage or limiting the number of people eligible for that tax credit under any replacement</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cutting Medicare benefits or payments to providers and plans</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Capping the exclusion of employer sponsored health plans from income and payroll taxes</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reducing the overall level of federal support for state Medicaid programs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Theoretically, lawmakers could look outside health care to fund ACA replacement legislation. Unfortunately, domestic discretionary spending, now at historic lows, could not provide much. Large scale defense or social security savings, even if advisable, would be politically unlikely, and tax reform advocates would fight to devote any revenue to the lowering of rates, not new health care spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Congress moves forward with repeal and transition, it seems likely that individual market customers and plans, Medicare beneficiaries and their providers, Medicaid programs in all 50 states and DC, and employers offering health coverage would be pitted directly against one another. What one gains, someone else will lose. For everyone with a stake in health care, it would amount to a war of all against all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your view of the ACA, why would any of us want to live through the scenario described above? Instead, let’s begin the hard work of identifying ways to confront the increasing unaffordability of coverage and care in this country.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, more Americans comparison-shop for their auto mechanics than for their doctors. Yet, prices vary greatly within geographic areas and are not consistently linked to quality. This indicates that if consumers were empowered to choose high value providers and services, they could receive better care and save money. Within the U.S., the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health savings accounts along with continued upward price trends makes it imperative for consumers to spend their health care dollars wisely. Lack of price and quality transparency presents a major barrier to consumer engagement. Access to information is only a first step, though. Value-based insurance design, which aligns consumers’ incentives with value, can further improve health care outcomes and affordability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health Care Quality and Price Transparency<br></strong>Individual consumers lack the information they need on the price and quality of medical services. With the following steps, we can begin to enhance transparency and provide all of us with better data to inform our health care choices:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Support the efforts of plans, employers and others to offer online tools that allow consumers to comparison-shop on both price and quality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Publicly report provider performance on a parsimonious set of outcome measures that are, wherever possible, endorsed by a robust multi-stakeholder process.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID)<br></strong>Consumers who seek out the highest value care should have a chance to realize financial savings. Value-based insurance design (VBID) bases cost-sharing on quality and value rather than price, reducing cost-sharing for health care services with demonstrated high value. VBID programs have achieved increased utilization of high-value services and prescriptions, produced better health outcomes for enrollees, and in some cases, generated cost savings.&nbsp;The following adjustments to current law and regulations would allow millions to benefit from value-based insurance:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enable Medicare Advantage plans, as well as Accountable Care Organizations, to reduce copays for high value providers and services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit consumer-directed health plans in the private market to cover certain evidence-based, high value services – such as podiatric foot exams and metformin for diabetics – prior to the exhaustion of the deductible.</li>

<h3>How Conservative Attacks on Health Reform Will Affect You</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conservatives are starting to implement their onslaught to repeal the Affordable Care Act this week as Republicans take control of the House of Representatives. They have scheduled a vote on January 12. If conservatives have their way and repeal the Affordable Care Act, we will go back to a health care system that failed millions of Americans: one with skyrocketing costs bankrupting families and our budget, fewer people with access to quality care, and more people at the mercy of the health insurance industry.</p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>A.C.T. - For America's Health</em></strong>&nbsp;is an initiative that aims to improve the quality of health care in the United States through:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Building public awareness of the need for quality improvement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Identifying exemplary ""best practices"" in health care - innovations that are yielding better patient outcomes; increasing access to timely medical care; lowering costs; making the health system easier to use; and reducing medical errors and inappropriate/unnecessary care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Accelerating the spread of best practices throughout the health system.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Changing the culture of medicine to nurture a greater focus on best practices and ""evidence-based"" care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who's doing it?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initiative is a collaborative effort of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). The NCHC is a non-profit, non-partisan education and information group based in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1990 and is comprised of some 90 organizations. These include corporations, unions, physician and other health provider groups, academic health centers, consumer and religious groups. NCHC members will help facilitate the initiative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IHI is an independent, non-profit education and research organization based in Boston, Mass. It was founded in 1991 with the goal of bringing health care leaders and organizations together to improve health care. IHI sponsors a wide array of educational forums for medical professionals and health care administrators. The co-founder and president, Donald M. Berwick, M.D., is one of the nation's leading authorities on heath care quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What's the time frame?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ACT initiative was launched in September 1998. An education campaign to raise awareness of the need for quality improvement in health care began in October, 1998 and is on-going. In 1999, IHI and NCHC have assembled two teams of leading experts to identify best practices in two areas - care at the end of life and reducing medical errors. Two reports compiling representative examples of exemplary care in each area will be published in early 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What, more specifically, does it involve?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reports will be widely disseminated to hospitals, doctors' and nurses' groups, managed care plans, health insurers, the media, key business and consumer groups, employee benefit managers, employer purchasing groups, federal and state government health agencies, and NCHC members. They will be posted on both the NCHC and IHI websites, and in the future on other web sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition will also use its members' communications channels to disseminate the reports and other data on best practices and evidence based medicine. IHI will disseminate the reports at its numerous training forums and symposia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC will join IHI in 2000 in sponsoring periodic forums on best practices in health care, aimed at a broad audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A media campaign will put before journalists a steady stream of information on the quality problem and the need for more broad-based solutions.<strong>Why this initiative and why now?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the U.S. health care system has unquestionable strengths and is known world-wide as the spawning ground for countless medical advancements and breakthroughs, it is also plagued with quality problems. Avoidable medical errors are on the rise. Some treatments, medical procedures, and medicines are vastly overused while others go underutilized. There is also a wide variation in care from one geographical area to another without medical justification. Health experts agree the system is fragmented and inefficient. And Americans are increasingly concerned about the quality of care they get or have access to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These problems are receiving increased attention. Both the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and a presidential blue ribbon panel recently concluded that quality improvement in health care must become one of the nation's highest public policy priorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>A.C.T - For America's Health</em></strong>&nbsp;seeks to build national momentum toward significant health system change that improves the quality of care. It seeks to accelerate the adoption by health professionals of proven best practices and the abandonment of practices that are unproven or even harmful. The initiative is unique in seeking to identify best practices in medicine that warrant broader attention from those who pay for and consume health care services - businesses, government and consumers. It is unique in seeking to create a grassroots movement for quality improvement. And it is a unique collaboration among national organizations (NCHC, IHI, and NCHC members), which have the capacity for broad impact through media outreach and direct communications to health care professionals and consumers.</p>

725,"<strong>FACTS ON THE COST OF HEALTH CARE</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite continued low general inflation in United States, health care spending continues to rise at two to three times the inflation rate. While the Consumer Price Index which measures general inflation, is projected to increase 3.0% for each of the next four years, health care inflation is projected to be 8.0% annually during that same period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health insurance premiums for employers are now rising at double-digit rates with many health plans expected to raise premiums 15% for large employers in 2002. It is anticipated that these premium increases will add another one million people to the ranks of the uninsured not counting the effects of an economic recession.<strong>Rising Costs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>National health care spending in 2001 will exceed $1.54 trillion. That is four times what we spent on health care in 1980 and is projected to exceed $2.3 trillion by 2009. (Source: Health Care Financing Administration)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The U.S. is spending over $5400 annually on every man, woman and child in this country; which is the largest per capita health expenditure in the world.</li>

<p><strong>Paying the Price</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Despite a brief period between 1994-1997 when health insurance premiums rose less rapidly, health insurance premiums for employers rose overall 8.3% in 2000 -- and 11% in 2001, which was four times the rate of inflation and the largest increase in premiums since 1992 (Source: NCHC).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Small businesses in some sectors will experience 25-30% premium increases in 2002 (Source: NCHC).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) - a bellwether of insurance pricing - had a 10% increase in 2000 and 10.5% in 2001.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In 1986, businesses spent an average of $1,600 per employee on health insurance. By 2000, that had risen to almost $4,600.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Impact on American Families</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A typical family's health care bill in 1998 was $6300 if you take in lowered wages, higher prices for goods and services, and part of their tax bill.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>One in six households headed by a person under age 65 spends 10 percent or more of its income on out-of-pocket costs plus directly paid premiums (Consumers Union). Experts agree that level of health care spending often makes it difficult to pay other bills.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The price of health insurance for workers has more than tripled over the last 13 years. In 1988, workers paid an average $48 a month for family coverage obtained through their jobs. By 2000, workers were paying $150 a month on average for that coverage (Health Research and Educational Trust).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Workers at firms with fewer than 200 employees paid 47% of the premium for family coverage in 2000, up from 34% in 1998 (HRET).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The percent of family income spent on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket payments ranged from a high of 17 percent for families with income under $10,000 to 3 percent for families with income of $100,000 and more.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Future Challenges</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many experts agree that our health care system is riddled with inefficiencies, excessive expenses, inflated prices, poor management, inappropriate care, waste and fraud. These problems significantly increase the cost of medical care and help push up the cost of health insurance for employers and consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policymakers have not yet agreed on the best ways to address these serious problems. Some favor price controls and imposing strict budgets on health care spending. Others believe that free market competition is the best way to solve the problem. Other experts believe that we can ""innovate"" our way to a less costly system through medical breakthroughs that cure or reduce the incidence of major diseases. Public health advocates believe that if all Americans adopted healthy lifestyles, health care costs would plummet as people required less medical care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There appears to be no single solution to medical care's high price tag. Most of the means mentioned above - and others - will have to be used in the years ahead to control costs. If they are not, the impact on consumers, employers and the government will be severe and the number of people without health insurance will continue to grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
726,"<strong>FACTS ON HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE</strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most Americans have health insurance through their employers. But employment is no longer a guarantee of health of health insurance coverage. As America continues to move from a manufacturing-based to a service economy, employee working patterns continue to evolve. An increasing reliance on part-time workers means fewer workers have access to employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. And due to rising premiums, many small employers cannot afford to offer health insurance. Companies that do offer health insurance often require employees to contribute a larger share toward their coverage. As a result, an increasing number of Americans have opted not to take advantage of job-based health insurance because they cannot afford it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number of Uninsured Continue to Grow:</strong>&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, an average of 500,000 people each year have been added to the ranks of those without health insurance.</p>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Although the strong economy has helped to decrease the number of uninsured over the last two years, that trend will be temporary. It is estimated that the combination of 11% health insurance premium increases that employers will incur on average and corporate layoffs due to the slowing economy, will result in another 1.2 million persons becoming uninsured in 2001. (Source: NCHC)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A sustained economic recession and escalating health insurance premiums could raise the number of uninsured to 55 million Americans by 2009. That means nearly 22% of all Americans under the age of 65 could be without health insurance in eight years.</li>

<p><strong>Why Do the Problems of Uninsured Americans Matter to All of Us?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being without health insurance affects peoples' job decisions, financial security, access to care, and health status. The uninsured have reduced access to care which has a significant impact on their health because they do not get the routine and preventive care they need, and they tend to seek medical attention when they are sicker.In addition, when an uninsured person does get care and cannot pay the full cost, some of the bill is passed on to those who do pay - through higher health insurance premiums and in the form of taxes spent on our public insurance programs.The three major problems facing our health care system today - the growing number of uninsured, mounting costs and poor quality care - are deeply interrelated. Efforts to expand health insurance coverage are made more difficult by rising health care costs and insurance premiums. We can never have the highest quality of care possible if we have a system in which tens of millions of people lack coverage and are increasingly unable to afford medical care if they do not have health insurance. A continually rising number of uninsured people will further destabilize an already strained and faltering health care system.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the Prevention Fund Now Could Cost Taxpayers Later</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the wake of today’s Senate cloture vote on S.2343, we urge both Houses of Congress to address this and other budgetary matters without imposing cuts to prevention programs which will cost taxpayers more in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seventy-five percent of current health care spending goes to treating preventable chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Investing in prevention is vital to curbing these costs.&nbsp; One George Washington University&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029665"">study</a>&nbsp;found that tobaccocessation efforts can save $3.12 for every dollar spent, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ajpmonline.org/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/AMEPRE_33853-stamped2.pdf"">new research</a>funded by the Centers on Disease Control found that by holding down the rate of obesity, the U.S. could save $550 billion dollars in health care costs over the next 20 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Prevention and Public Health Fund is helping people and communities in every state take on the responsibility of these chronic conditions early—before patients need costly and avoidable hospital and emergency room care.&nbsp; Programs which receive Fund support included:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Immunization programs to stop the spread of diseases afflicting children and adults ($190 million in FY 2012),</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<p><em>by Associate Policy Director Emily Haas</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sustaining a strong and resilient primary care workforce is essential to improving patient access to care and winning the battle against chronic disease—the central threat to health care affordability. The impact of the primary care shortage on both providers and patients has been huge, and lessening this impact must continue to be a federal priority beyond September 30th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When physicians are trained in the communities, they are more likely to stay in these communities—many of which are underserved areas. When physicians fill these provider gaps, they can contribute great value to overall population health management as governments and stakeholders alike seek to find new ways to improve population health with targeted interventions. Primary care providers are essential to the betterment of population health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fact sheet released by the Coalition highlights the importance of key workforce policies to primary care and is a part of the NCHC’s overall strategy and policy of strengthening primary care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, NCHC along with partners AAFP, ACP, NACHC, and AOA&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/event/avoiding-the-cliff-strengthening-the-primary-care-workforce/"">hosted a briefing</a>&nbsp;stressing the important role played in&nbsp; primary care by federal &nbsp;workforce and health center programs. The need for action to preserve existing federal support for the Federal Qualified Health Center (FQHC), National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education programs is a vital one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speakers from all three organizations illustrated the value of these programs and the need to reauthorize funding. Jack Ende, M.D. of ACP&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/event/avoiding-the-cliff-strengthening-the-primary-care-workforce/"">made the argument</a>&nbsp;for investing in primary care by noting that U.S. adults with primary care providers have lower odds of premature death and overall have 33% lower health costs. Furthermore, states with higher ratios of primary care doctors have better health outcomes and decreased Medicare expenditures.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clif Knight, M.D.&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Clif-Knight.pdf"">highlighted the maldistribution</a>&nbsp;of primary care doctors in his presentation. An increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 people is associated with an average mortality reduction of 5.3%, or 49 fewer deaths per 100,000 per year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Verduzco, M.D.&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Maria-Verduzco.pdf"">shared her personal experience</a>&nbsp;as an NHSC recipient and someone who has long been a part of the community she serves. She returned to her home of Yakama, WA after medical school &nbsp;&nbsp;to train at the local Teaching Health Center. Dr. Verduzco’s story is a prime example of the system working—training physicians where they are needed most and keeping them there.&nbsp; She also spoke to the important role community health centers play in addressing the primary care needs of an underserved population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Sealey, D.O.—also a product of the NHSC program—<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sealey-PowerPoint-Presentation.pdf"">discussed his experience</a>&nbsp;with underserved populations in the Detroit area and their partnerships with local universities. As a part of his work, Dr. Sealey runs a Teaching Health Center that requires residents receive a 2-year population health certification. This is a prime example of how the THCGME program fosters innovation in the primary care space and the integration of primary care with community-based services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These important programs are set to expire in just a few days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As emphasized through the speakers’ presentations, these programs&nbsp;have a direct impact&nbsp;on not only physician workforce and training but on patients. Thus, NCHC encourages Congress to act by reauthorizing funding for Federal Qualified Health Center, National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education programs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May 17, 2017</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the more than 520 undersigned organizations, we are writing to warn of the dire consequences of repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund (the Prevention Fund), which is repealed by the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) at the end of FY 2018. Repealing the Prevention Fund without a corresponding increase in the allocation for the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill would leave a funding gap for essential public health programs, and could also foretell substantial cuts for other critical programs funded in the bill. As the Senate begins work on its version of health reform, we urge you to leave the Prevention and Public Health Fund in place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, more than 12 percent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) budget is supplied through Prevention Fund investments. This includes core public health programs that provide essential funds to help states keep communities healthy and safe, such as the 317 immunization program, epidemiology and laboratory capacity grants, the entire Preventive Health and Health Services (Prevent) Block Grant program, cancer screenings, chronic disease prevention and other critically important programs. For example, the Prevent Block Grant provides all 50 states, the District of Columbia, two American Indian tribes, and eight U.S. territories with flexible funding to address their unique public health issues at the state and community level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the growing and geographically disparate burden of largely preventable diseases, health threats such as the opioid epidemic, and emerging infectious disease outbreaks such as the Zika virus, federal disease prevention and public health programs remain critically underfunded. Public health spending is still below pre-recession levels, having remained relatively flat for years. The CDC’s budget authority has actually decreased by 11.4 percent since FY 2010 adjusted for inflation, and the Prevention Fund has helped to make up the difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discretionary programs, including public health, education, and job training programs funded through the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education (LHHS) appropriations spending bill have been cut dramatically and disproportionately in recent years as lawmakers have worked to<br>reduce the deficit, even though experts across the political spectrum agree these programs are not a driving factor behind our nation’s mid- and long term fiscal challenges. Eliminating the Prevention Fund would be disastrous to the CDC budget and programs, and to the LHHS bill as a whole, leaving a nearly $1 billion budget hole which would be impossible to fill under current discretionary spending caps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funding prevention not only saves lives but it saves money.&nbsp; A comprehensive study of evidence-based prevention programs found that every dollar invested yields $5.60 in savings. There are many provisions of the Affordable Care Act aimed at promoting health and prevention, but the Prevention Fund is particularly important – a dedicated investment in prevention and public health activities to counteract the much larger bill – $3.2 trillion and growing – we pay every year as a country to treat illness and disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We urge you to maintain funding made possible by the Prevention and Public Health Fund and safeguard funding for the CDC and other programs under the Labor-HHS-Education spending bill.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery and Benefit Innovation Claims the Spotlight on Capitol Hill</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care delivery and benefits innovations that curb costs by improving care took center stage at the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) Forum on Capitol Hill today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Across this country, nurses, physicians and health plans are implementing exciting solutions that lower costs and improve care. It is time we brought these programs to scale nationwide,” said event moderator Joe Minarik. Minarik serves as a member of NCHC’s Board and as Senior Vice President at the Committee for Economic Development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event’s panel discussion featured real world leaders who are leading successful efforts to improve health care value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joelle Frizzera, a nurse practitioner and Clinical Services Manager for Evercare Mid-Atlantic, supervises a program that relies on nurse practitioners to improve care for frail nursing home residents with complex medical needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Evercare Model is really about providing accountable care, demonstrating better quality, outcomes and satisfaction – and in a manner that treats each patient according to their best care needs and options.&nbsp; And we’re able to do this for patients in their existing care environment which means care costs are cut significantly,” said Frizzera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bill Estabrook, Executive Director of the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OP &amp;F), is responsible for the retirement and health benefits of 55,000 active members, retirees and their family members. Implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program as part of a broader health and wellness effort helped his organization achieve savings as large as 16% below previous trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The wellness initiatives in place at OP&amp;F have been popular and effective. I speak from experience as not only the CEO of our organization, but someone who was identified as high risk for Type 2 Diabetes. My coworkers and I have all benefited from the programs in place and the money spent on this initiative pays dividends in many ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Jerry Penso, the Chief Medical and Quality Officer for the American Medical Group Association, highlighted ways to help consumers and patients choose high-quality, integrated health care providers and systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Penso, “At some point in our lives, each of us will face an illness for ourselves or a loved one, so choosing the right doctor can be a critical decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet choosing the right physician is only one part of the equation—finding a high-performing health care system that supports your physician in delivering excellent care is also vital to achieving the best health.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event is the fifth of an ongoing series of NCHC Forums, which are designed to bring together thought-leaders, policymakers and stakeholders for timely public discussions about the future of America’s health system.</p>

<p>Over the past twenty years, “blockbuster” drugs have been the consistent drivers of pharmaceutical company sales and profits. Products, such as Lipitor and Plavix, have become synonymous not only with billions in annual global sales, but also have become proven, trusted medications for physicians and patients. In the coming years, many of these “stalwarts” have or will lose patent protection, thus adversely impacting the bottom line of pharmaceutical companies. In response to approaching the “patent cliff,” the pharmaceutical industry has turned to increased mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) to guarantee revenue through sales of newly acquired drugs, as well as future profits from a renewed pipeline. Although M&amp;A has been the hallmark of the drug development and manufacturing industry, companies are seeking new methods to replenish pipelines and secure profits, starting with the development of new chemicals entities (NCEs) and pharmaceutical ingredients.</p>

Although M&amp;A has been the hallmark of the drug development and manufacturing industry, companies are seeking new methods to replenish pipelines and secure profits, starting with the development of new chemicals entities (NCEs) and pharmaceutical ingredients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303365804576432170845403108.html"">US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>, the agency has approved 20 new molecular entities (NMEs) so far this year, which is one behind the total for full year 2010. Janet Woodcock, the head of the FDA’s drug division, stated that so-called first cycle approvals are at a 20 year high. She attributes this turning point in the industry to an increased focus on&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303499204576387423702555648.html"">innovation and collaboration</a>, especially in disease areas that have few, if any, approved treatments. Not only is the industry primed to approve more new drugs this year than the past few, but also it has reformulated its research and development (R&amp;D) strategy to bolster waning pipelines. This reconfiguration in both mindset and approach will create an influx of new medicines into the market, but is it enough to propel drugs to “blockbuster” status?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newly launched drugs, those products that have been on the market for two years or less, accounted for&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/ims/Global/Content/Insights/IMS%20Institute%20for%20Healthcare%20Informatics/IHII_UseOfMed_report1_.pdf"">$11.8 billion in US sales</a>&nbsp;in 2005. These sales were the direct result of targeted marketing and advertising campaigns. On average pharmaceutical companies spend approximately $60 billion on marketing to physicians and consumers. Despite the billions expended on promotion, US sales of newly launched drugs peaked at $4.3 billion in 2010. A chief executive at Target Rx, a market research and consulting firm, stated that it takes longer for new drugs to get sales and the peak is less than it used to be. It appears that FDA approval is only the first step in achieving “blockbuster” status, for pharmaceutical companies must overcome numerous hurdles to reach $1 billion in annual sales for a newly approved drug.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904233404576459851152423110.html"">obstacles</a>&nbsp;on the path to “blockbuster” status are many and range from reimbursement and payment methods to competition and insufficient data. With respect to the latter, physicians are often apprehensive to prescribe a new drug, due to the lack of prolonged studies and data. Physicians’ fears of prescribing medicines with unknown side effects or adverse events are further exacerbated by the practice of improper pharmaceutical marketing. Despite a recent government crackdown, drug reps promote products “off-label,” meaning a medicine is promoted as a treatment for a disease that it is not indicated to treat. Although the pharmaceutical maybe effective in combating the condition, it may carry side effects that are also not included on the label. This clearly points to a safety issue and clinicians do not want to be responsible for another Vioxx.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although quality and safety are central to prescribing habits, perhaps the primary factor affecting drug sales is cost. Cost pervades medical decisions made by patients, physicians and payers. Although pharmaceutical companies continue to sink costs into convincing insurers and government run health systems alike to cover expensive new drugs, this will be an arduous and endless battle that could spell defeat, especially when a reliable and affordable generic alternative is also on the market. Generics, time and again, have proven to be as safe and effective as their brand-name counterparts. This is reiterated in their increasing share of the drug market. Total branded and unbranded generic market share has risen in each of the past five years and now accounts for 78 percent of all prescriptions dispensed. Over the coming years, this number will continue to grow as branded drugs lose patent protection and as health care providers seek proven methods at cutting health care costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Costs related to competition are not the sole deterrent to achieving “blockbuster” status. Reimbursement rates and subsequent difficulties, especially for expensive treatments, often delay the adoption of a medicine. Case in point –&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903366504576488044215714126.html"">Provenge</a>, a pricey prostate cancer drug that received regulatory approval in April 2010. Provenge, like many other immunotherapies, is given over a short period of time and generally requires a larger, upfront cash outlay by physicians. In turn, the reimbursement process is complicated and cumbersome, and often results in delays, as well as preventing small practice clinicians from utilizing the drug. In the case of this prostate drug, one which had a long fight to gain FDA approval, sales have not met expectations and the question remains on whether the drug will hit analyst estimates. Similarly, will other drugs face this same fate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all of these hurdles, and the chance of more arising, is it the end of “blockbuster” drugs? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Over the past twenty years, “blockbuster” drugs have been the consistent drivers of pharmaceutical company sales and profits. Products, such as Lipitor and Plavix, have become synonymous not only with billions in annual global sales, but also have become proven, trusted medications for physicians and patients. In the coming years, many of these “stalwarts” have or will lose patent protection, thus adversely impacting the bottom line of pharmaceutical companies. In response to approaching the “patent cliff,” the pharmaceutical industry has turned to increased mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) to guarantee revenue through sales of newly acquired drugs, as well as future profits from a renewed pipeline. Although M&amp;A has been the hallmark of the drug development and manufacturing industry, companies are seeking new methods to replenish pipelines and secure profits, starting with the development of new chemicals entities (NCEs) and pharmaceutical ingredients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303365804576432170845403108.html"">US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>, the agency has approved 20 new molecular entities (NMEs) so far this year, which is one behind the total for full year 2010. Janet Woodcock, the head of the FDA’s drug division, stated that so-called first cycle approvals are at a 20 year high. She attributes this turning point in the industry to an increased focus on&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303499204576387423702555648.html"">innovation and collaboration</a>, especially in disease areas that have few, if any, approved treatments. Not only is the industry primed to approve more new drugs this year than the past few, but also it has reformulated its research and development (R&amp;D) strategy to bolster waning pipelines. This reconfiguration in both mindset and approach will create an influx of new medicines into the market, but is it enough to propel drugs to “blockbuster” status?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newly launched drugs, those products that have been on the market for two years or less, accounted for&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/ims/Global/Content/Insights/IMS%20Institute%20for%20Healthcare%20Informatics/IHII_UseOfMed_report1_.pdf"">$11.8 billion in US sales</a>&nbsp;in 2005. These sales were the direct result of targeted marketing and advertising campaigns. On average pharmaceutical companies spend approximately $60 billion on marketing to physicians and consumers. Despite the billions expended on promotion, US sales of newly launched drugs peaked at $4.3 billion in 2010. A chief executive at Target Rx, a market research and consulting firm, stated that it takes longer for new drugs to get sales and the peak is less than it used to be. It appears that FDA approval is only the first step in achieving “blockbuster” status, for pharmaceutical companies must overcome numerous hurdles to reach $1 billion in annual sales for a newly approved drug.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904233404576459851152423110.html"">obstacles</a>&nbsp;on the path to “blockbuster” status are many and range from reimbursement and payment methods to competition and insufficient data. With respect to the latter, physicians are often apprehensive to prescribe a new drug, due to the lack of prolonged studies and data. Physicians’ fears of prescribing medicines with unknown side effects or adverse events are further exacerbated by the practice of improper pharmaceutical marketing. Despite a recent government crackdown, drug reps promote products “off-label,” meaning a medicine is promoted as a treatment for a disease that it is not indicated to treat. Although the pharmaceutical maybe effective in combating the condition, it may carry side effects that are also not included on the label. This clearly points to a safety issue and clinicians do not want to be responsible for another Vioxx.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although quality and safety are central to prescribing habits, perhaps the primary factor affecting drug sales is cost. Cost pervades medical decisions made by patients, physicians and payers. Although pharmaceutical companies continue to sink costs into convincing insurers and government run health systems alike to cover expensive new drugs, this will be an arduous and endless battle that could spell defeat, especially when a reliable and affordable generic alternative is also on the market. Generics, time and again, have proven to be as safe and effective as their brand-name counterparts. This is reiterated in their increasing share of the drug market. Total branded and unbranded generic market share has risen in each of the past five years and now accounts for 78 percent of all prescriptions dispensed. Over the coming years, this number will continue to grow as branded drugs lose patent protection and as health care providers seek proven methods at cutting health care costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Costs related to competition are not the sole deterrent to achieving “blockbuster” status. Reimbursement rates and subsequent difficulties, especially for expensive treatments, often delay the adoption of a medicine. Case in point –&nbsp;<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903366504576488044215714126.html"">Provenge</a>, a pricey prostate cancer drug that received regulatory approval in April 2010. Provenge, like many other immunotherapies, is given over a short period of time and generally requires a larger, upfront cash outlay by physicians. In turn, the reimbursement process is complicated and cumbersome, and often results in delays, as well as preventing small practice clinicians from utilizing the drug. In the case of this prostate drug, one which had a long fight to gain FDA approval, sales have not met expectations and the question remains on whether the drug will hit analyst estimates. Similarly, will other drugs face this same fate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>With all of these hurdles, and the chance of more arising, is it the end of “blockbuster” drugs? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Current drug pricing trends, particularly in the specialty drug sector, seriously threaten the affordability of health care in the United States. For years, patients and purchasers have shouldered prices of more than $100,000 a year for certain medicines—particularly those that treat relatively rare disorders.&nbsp; But in a concerning new development, the industry is increasingly applying rare-disease pricing to treatments for diseases afflicting millions: hepatitis, cancer, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. If this trend is left unchecked, American health care will soon face an untenable choice: reduce access to medications needed to manage common chronic conditions or face increasingly unaffordable cost burdens. NCHC supports the following policy solutions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Accelerate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Review of Competitor Drugs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Prioritize FDA review of 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;in class medicines, when such a review would speed treatment alternatives to the market and lower costs for&nbsp;remedies that have a system-wide cost impact</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Provide FDA with the additional funding needed to more rapidly process new generic drug applications</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Require Transparency in Launch Pricing for Prescription Drugs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Require brand name manufacturers to provide planned price and target population prior to launch of prescription drugs with high cost impact,&nbsp;allowing public programs and private payers to anticipate financing needs and adjust accordingly</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Invest in Comparative Effectiveness Research</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enhance public funding of studies comparing the clinical effectiveness and safety of drugs; lift restrictions on study of the relative cost-effectiveness of&nbsp;drugs and other treatments</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Provide a Strong Pathway for Generic Biosimilar Drugs<br></strong>Support federal regulation and state policies that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Require generic biosimilar and originator products to use the same International Non-proprietary Name (INN)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Encourage appropriate substitution of biosimilar drugs for brand name biologics and oppose regulations and state laws preventing substitution of&nbsp;biosimilars</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure CMS makes reimbursement policy changes in Medicare Parts B and D necessary to assure adequate reimbursement for biologics and thereby&nbsp;promote biosimilar development</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairmen Brady and Walden, and Representatives Neal and Pallone:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We, the undersigned organizations representing Medicare Advantage Dual-eligible Special Needs Plans, health care providers, and advocates, are writing to urge Congress to permanently authorize the Medicare Advantage Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) program this year. D-SNPs play an important role in delivering and coordinating Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries and tailor care management, provider interventions, and partnerships with community-based organizations to the unique needs of their dual-eligible enrollees. We believe that this program, in existence for over a decade, has demonstrated its vital role in serving the dual-eligible population. Congress should finally give this program the long-term stability that states, plans, and beneficiaries need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, D-SNPs have been reauthorized several times with bipartisan support, but through a series of short-term extensions. As it stands, the program’s authorization expires at the end of 2018.&nbsp; Full integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits through the D-SNPs’ contracts with states or between D-SNPs and managed long-term care services and supports (MLTSS) plans requires intensive work and collaboration spanned across multiple years. Short-term reauthorizations impede states and plans from entering longer-term partnerships and making investments in integration by creating uncertainty and questions surrounding Congress’ support of the program. To provide stability for states, plans, and the nearly 2 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in D-SNPs, we believe that Congress should, in the best case, permanently authorize D-SNPs or, at a minimum provide a long-term reauthorization of no less than seven years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare/Medicaid Dual Eligibles are among the most-costly and hardest-to-serve populations receiving benefits in either program and we believe that the D-SNP program offers great opportunity and potential to improve care and benefits coordination and quality of care.&nbsp; It is widely believed that the reauthorization of the D-SNP program will accompany other Medicare extenders legislation and we strongly urge this bipartisan program to accompany this or other priority legislation moving through the House as soon as possible.&nbsp; The Senate Finance Committee has already signaled its unanimous and bipartisan support for permanent reauthorization and we urge the House to do the same.&nbsp; That is why we are urging you, as bipartisan leaders in the House of Representatives, to move legislation permanently authorizing D-SNPs this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In advance, thank you for your consideration of this request.</p>

<p>June 22, 2011</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority, many small business owners offer health insurance coverage because not only does it hone their competitive edge, but also aids in recruitment of new staff and retaining current employees. This perspective stands in contrast to a recent McKinsey &amp; Co. study, which claimed that there will be a 30 percent decrease in employer-sponsored health insurance due to the passage of the ACA.</p>

750,"SGR Reform within Reach Early Next Year… If Congress Can Find the Will","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>December 12, 2013</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Contact: Larry McNeely<br></strong><strong>&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:lmcneely@nchc.org"">lmcneely@nchc.org<br></a></strong><strong>202-638-7151, ext. 109</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by NCHC President and CEO John Rother on today’s approval of SGR repeal and payment reform legislation by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“Today’s votes offer the full House and Senate a real opportunity early next year to repeal SGR and deliver better quality care at a lower price… if Congress can find the will to seize it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legislation approved today did not include offsets, and it is vital that any final bill employs smart savings designed to reduce costs through care improvement, not cost-shifting and blunt cuts to benefits or provider reimbursement. However, the Committees did act today to</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>launch promising new initiatives which will help deliver better care at lower costs for beneficiaries facing chronic conditions</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>accelerate the transition to cost-saving alternative payment models like ACOs and medical homes</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>ensure that Medicare dollars are spent wisely by basing payment on the quality and value of care that beneficiaries receive; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>take crucial first steps toward more health care transparency which would help providers deliver and consumers choose the best quality and value care possible.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both Committees approved bills with shared core components, the Senate Finance Committee bill deserves particular praise for amended language which combats fraud, improves the bill’s transparency language and bolsters mental health care. The Finance bill also includes provisions to extend Medicare and Medicaid programs for low-income enrollees and authority for Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, today’s votes set an strong example for&nbsp;how to tackle&nbsp;the challenge of health care cost and quality through bipartisan agreement. The Committees ended the SGR’s Medicare provider cuts and modernized the payment system for physicians and other professionals; the full House and Senate should follow their lead.”</p>

<p><em>Statement by John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services is considering regulatory and administrative steps to assure stability and affordability in the non-group and small group markets.&nbsp; In the weeks ahead, with its member organizations, NCHC will evaluate how the specific provisions of this regulation impact affordability and stability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“But no market stabilization effort can succeed if policymakers disrupt existing coverage arrangements rather than improving on them.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To provide any real assurance of stability as the current health care debate proceeds, leaders in Congress and the Administration will have to make a few broader policy commitments—<em>both for the 2017-2018 period and future years:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Maintain Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Assistance:</strong>&nbsp;To avoid destabilization of the non-group market, financial assistance for low- and moderate-income consumers, now provided through the Affordability Tax Credit and Cost Sharing Reduction subsidies, must either be maintained or improved upon.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Preserve the State Option to Expand Medicaid Eligibility</strong>:&nbsp; Medicaid policy impacts the individual and small group markets in all fifty states. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that Marketplace premiums are 7% lower for those states which have expanded Medicaid. Even if Congress retains tax credits and cost-sharing assistance, any substantial rollback of federal matching support for Medicaid expansion, or Medicaid in general, would push more lower-income consumers into their states’ already unsteady non-group markets.&nbsp; This could drive up premiums and generate further instability in the private market.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Provide Ongoing Risk-Stabilization Support:</strong>&nbsp;Full federal payments must be made under the existing reinsurance program, a mechanism designed to partially offset the claims of high-cost patients. Moving forward, additional, federally-funded risk stabilization support is needed to offset the high-cost claims for those consumers with significant medical needs.&nbsp; This support is crucial to ensure market stability and to mitigate cost growth.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We call on leaders in Congress and the Administration to quickly commit to these goals, and turn promptly to the difficult, bipartisan work of improving health care affordability.”</p>

<p><strong>SGR and Payment Reform Package Earns Bipartisan Support in the House</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by John Rother, CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, regarding bipartisan discussion draft released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Republicans and Democrats have finally crafted a major health care bill they can both support- and with health care costs continuing to grow, it is about time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This discussion draft once and for all would end the threat of deep cuts to physician payment that could disrupt access for the 47 million seniors and disabled Americans on Medicare.&nbsp;But as importantly, it could begin to hold down the cost of health care - by transforming how physicians and other health professionals are compensated. Instead of rewarding the number and complexity of medical tests and procedures, payment updates would depend on the quality of care and the health outcomes of their patients. To achieve those aims, physicians could opt to pursue innovative alternative payment models, such as accountable care or medical homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Securing bipartisan support for a bill this ambitious is an achievement in itself, but more has to be done to perfect the legislation and move toward enactment.&nbsp;The&nbsp; Energy and Commerce Committee will consider the bill next week. Then the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee must find ways to improve it, and Congress must find a way to pay for and pass the legislation – without shattering the bipartisan support it enjoys or shifting costs in ways make health care less affordable.&nbsp; The National Coalition on Health Care will work to ensure they do just that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For now, though, the bill’s authors, Representatives Burgess, Dingell, Pallone, Pitts, Upton, and Waxman, should be commended for exemplifying bipartisan cooperation and leadership. On this issue at least, let’s hope their colleagues in the House and Senate can live up to their example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Paying for value, not volume, is vital to the sustainability of our health system, and an SGR bill could be the one viable legislative vehicle this Congress for advancing that important aim.”</p>

756,"Several Stakeholder Organizations Call on Congress to Pass Permanent Special Needs Plan Reauthorization","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, DC – On February 2, thirteen leading organizations called on Congressional leadership to&nbsp;include the Medicare Extenders package – and specifically the permanent reauthorization for the Medicare Advantage (MA) Special Needs Plan (SNP) program – in the February 8th Continuing Resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Congress should take advantage of this opportunity to pass widely supported bipartisan reforms that will help beneficiaries with complex needs access innovative, high value care,” urged John Rother, President and CEO of NCHC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter argues that a permanent reauthorization for SNPs is essential to spur investment and foster innovation in the areas of coordinated care, disease management, and telehealth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to NCHC, the following organizations signed onto this letter: Alliance of Community Health Plans, America’s Health Insurance Plans, Anthem Inc., Better Medicare Alliance, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Association for Community Affiliated Plans, Healthcare Leadership Council, Meals on Wheels America, National Alliance on Mental Illness, SCAN Health Plan, and SNP Alliance.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cheryl Phillips, M.D., President and CEO, SNP Alliance:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Special Needs Plans are designed to serve the needs of vulnerable high-risk and high-cost individuals. Permanent reauthorization of SNPs is critical to maintain stability of these plans and access for beneficiaries. Application deadlines for plans are only days away. Further delays in reauthorization could result in significant barriers for the SNPs to enroll and serve these special needs populations – resulting in potential increased cost and care disruptions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Andrew Sperling, Director of Legislative Advocacy, National Alliance on Mental Illness:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Renewing the Dual Eligible SNPs is a critical priority for NAMI.&nbsp; Medicare beneficiaries living with mental illness that are concurrently eligible for Medicaid need the certainty that the coordinated care that they rely on everyday will continue.&nbsp; Congress must act on renewal of these health plans that serve vulnerable low-income beneficiaries.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Justine Handelman, SrVP, Office of Policy and Representation, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Special Needs Plans are a critical part of the Medicare Advantage program and without their continued reauthorization, they will end in 2019, which will be a great loss to all affected beneficiaries who benefit from the value of these plans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mary R. Grealy, President, Healthcare Leadership Council:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Medicare spending growth has long been driven by those beneficiaries who face the most severe, complex physical and mental health challenges.&nbsp; Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans are achieving high-quality care at reduced costs and clearly warrant permanent reauthorization by Congress.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allyson Y. Schwartz, President and CEO, Better Medicare Alliance:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Permanent authorization has been a top priority for Better Medicare Alliance, with our efforts leading a coalition of stakeholders and beneficiaries to strongly advocate for reauthorization. A stable environment is needed for SNPs to continue to provide successful models of care for high-risk, high-need beneficiaries with complex conditions. As we approach the next CR, we call on Congress to act now to permanently reauthorize Special Needs Plans that are providing innovation care management tailored to those with special needs under Medicare Advantage.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By Ami Patel</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently started looking for a new primary care doctor, and when doing my research, both on the web and by referrals through friends, the doctors with the most enthusiastic support were the ones who were approachable and established a positive, communicative relationship with their patients. As I noticed this trend in categorizing a doctor as great or mediocre based on their communication level, I began to question why the rhetoric of provider groups has not transitioned into focusing more on patient engagement. After all, the doctor is a resource for healthcare information, and when we seek healthcare, there should be full disclosure of what is best for our body and lifestyle. It seems counterproductive when the provider withholds their true opinion in fear of offending or frightening the patient. How can the patient be empowered to take a multifaceted approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle when the doctor fears the patient is not capable of handling such a diagnosis?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why should we care about the Farm Bill? Isn’t it policy that supports America’s farms and farmers? Well partially, but it also influences food policy: the availability of certain foods, prices, clean drinking water, chemical-free healthy food, food stamps, etc. It covers a wide range of issues that will, in some form, affect you and your health.</p>

<p><em>By Nishi Singhal</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When talking about wellness programs, seniors are often left out of the conversation. But many seniors are obese or engage in less physical activities as they age. It is no surprise then that the most frequently occurring conditions among seniors are linked to hypertension, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Studies have established the effectiveness of senior wellness programs that improve the overall health through increased physical activity, better nutrition, smoking cessation, and support of other healthy behaviors. They’ve demonstrated reduced inpatient admissions, health care costs, and improved health-related quality of life. With chronic disease and high health care expenditures plaguing our health care system, why not promote a large-scale senior wellness program through a program that directly cares for the group? A Medicare Wellness Program!</p>

<p><em>By Rachel Lynn Wilson</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid is a serious problem in America’s health care system. Improper payments currently cost our government $70 billion per year. Congressional action is needed to eliminate improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid. We must increase our investment in fraud prevention and enforcement programs and increase penalties, without impeding the delivery of health care services to beneficiaries. &nbsp;The FAST Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Thomas Carper and Sen. Thomas Coburn, includes essential policy changes to help combat fraud.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By Ami Patel</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an era where technology has seemingly permeated the majority of our lifestyle, the health system continues to struggle with the application and utilization of information technology to create a more efficient and accessible system. The implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) seems like a no-brainer solution to organize the health system, especially in a world where technology has replaced traditional forms of organization and communication with spreadsheets, emails and apps. Then why is the American health system still struggling to adopt a widespread EHR? The answer lies in a fragmented system characterized by a continuum of provider care ranging from traditional, small physician practices to larger, high-tech health centers. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States that affects over 1 in 3 adult men and women and about 1 in 5 children and adolescents. Obesity and its associated problems comprise about 10% of all medical spending nationally and have a large economic impact on our health care system. Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is a key factor driving this growing problem, but evidence shows that the implementation of a penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages will reduce consumption and its associated problems. Preventing disease saves money and will improve the health status of Americans.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical Malpractice lawsuits cost the system $54.4 billion per year, which is 2.4 percent of total health care spending. A large amount of medical malpractice awards are usurped by legal fees and administrative costs and thus do not end up with the injured patient. There is an urgent need for medical malpractice reform to ensure the patient receives a just reward, curb the rising cost of health care and foster better patient-centered outcomes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite slowing rates in health care expenditures in recent years, health care services delivered during a hospital admission remain the largest proportion of health care dollars spent in the US.&nbsp;Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, CMS released a rule Act that calls for reimbursement and incentive payments to be based on value, known as the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program (HVBPP).&nbsp;The Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program helps to reorganize the focus of health care delivery.&nbsp;This policy is pivotal and deserves more attention because it has the potential to change societal views on health care delivery.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drug safety is an issue that has been and continues to remain a hot topic amongst patients, health professionals and the media. Although strides have been made in addressing issues, thus decreasing the advent of adverse events and increasing the quality of some pharmaceutical products, much work remains. Safety concerns are not singular to one specific component of the drug industry, but pervade development, manufacturing and marketing. In order to properly address these issues, the federal government, regulatory agencies and drug manufacturers must come together to not only ensure the safety and quality of medicines, but also to increase patient compliance.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on pace to approve more drugs in 2011 than the previous year, numerous hurdles remain that can impede a newly approved drugs path to “blockbuster” status. Obstacles, such as improper promotion and marketing and competition from both brand-name and generic drugs do and will continue to stall profits. Above all, the primary factor affecting newly approved drug sales is cost – cost of the product, payment methods and slow reimbursement. Each one of these hurdles, either working in tandem or singularly, could spell the end to “blockbuster” drugs.</p>

<p>Increase in the Number of Insured Children Shows Progress, But Major Problems Persist</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henry Simmons, M.D., President of the National Coalition on Health Care, released the following statement today in response to the HHS report on enrollment in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""The latest Health and Human Services (HHS) figures, which show that 1.3 million children were added to SCHIP last year, demonstrate that public health insurance programs can be effective in reaching lower-income, uninsured populations. However, there is still a great deal of work to be done in order to achieve universal health insurance coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""First, there are still nearly 6 million uninsured children with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty who are eligible for SCHIP benefits, as well as Medicaid coverage. More effective outreach and enrollment strategies are needed to help eligible families better understand the benefits of SCHIP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Second, the President's budget for fiscal year 2003 calls for no new resources to help states insure more uninsured children. The budget does call for a partial give-back to states of unspent SCHIP funds. But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also estimates that nearly 1 million children could lose their health insurance coverage over the next four years, due to prior congressional funding restraints. Without new federal funds, it will be difficult for states to retain current coverage levels or expand coverage to our most vulnerable population - uninsured children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Third, according to the HHS report, many states have already been reporting high turnover in children's coverage - often as high as 50 percent of the enrollees in their programs. It is critically important that state programs focus more of their efforts on providing continuity of coverage for enrollees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""The President and the Congress should act immediately to insure that no lower-income children lose their health coverage, and that substantial funds be set aside this year to expand coverage and to assist states in their outreach and enrollment efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""And we must not ignore the fact that this country cannot achieve universal coverage without addressing the related issues of cost and quality. With costs rising at three times the rate of general inflation and problems of quality adding to the overall costs, our country is facing a serious crisis in our health care system.""</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority, many small business owners offer health insurance coverage because not only does it hone their competitive edge, but also aids in recruitment of new staff and retaining current employees. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may make insurance coverage more affordable for many small businesses through health insurance exchanges allowing small businesses to purchase lower-cost, higher quality plans. This perspective stands in contrast to a recent McKinsey &amp; Co. study, which claimed that there will be a 30 percent decrease in employer-sponsored health insurance due to the passage of the ACA. In addition, the McKinsey report appears to be an outlier in research on this topic. According to Arensmeyer, the report also ignores the fact that employers have been dropping health coverage benefits under the status quo, and the numbers will increase without reform.</p>

764,"Safety Continues to Elude Drug Development and Manufacturing","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August 12, 2011</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Shelley Jazowski</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent post, I commented on the safety of generic medications specific to product labeling. Safety concerns are not singular to generics, but pervade the drug development, manufacturing and marketing components of the overall prescription drug industry. Below, I outline three primary concerns and comment on their proposed solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Lack of Oversight of Internationally Produced Products</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This first issue is a direct result from the increased globalization of the drug development industry. Due to the economic impacts, pharmaceutical manufacturers collaborate with global partners to produce pharmaceutical ingredients or products, and this trend shows no sign of slowing. The<a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-07/phg-pfs071111.php"">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>&nbsp;estimates that 40 percent of finished drugs and 80 percent of active ingredient and bulk chemicals are imported from overseas. With this influx of internationally manufactured products comes the threat of substandard and/or adulterated materials, similar to the tainted Heparin, produced in and shipped from China, which was responsible for dozens of deaths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Accountability for the Entire Supply Chain and Standardized Regulations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution to the lack of oversight involved in the manufacture and trade of pharmaceutical products does not rest with one party, but must be equally addressed by the federal government, domestic pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies. Not only should Congress impose national standards on drug wholesalers, but lawmakers should also require the private sector to both track and verify the authenticity of pharmaceuticals. To that end, pharmaceutical manufacturers should create systems that ensure quality and safety, thus making them responsible for the entire supply chain, including improved testing, transparency and auditing. The solution would not be complete without increased inspections from the FDA and/or approved third parties. Only then would Americans be guaranteed safer and higher quality medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Counterfeit Medications</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some cases, the cause of one safety issues spurs another. Increased globalization leads to the threat of contaminated medicines, but also increases the likelihood of an influx of counterfeit drugs. Counterfeit medications can infiltrate the market, thus causing physical harm to patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Varied Color and Shape of Brand-Name and Generic Drugs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar to the how the cause of one safety issue can set off a chain reaction of subsequent harmful events, so too can proposed solutions. One such solution is the shape and color of medications. When a generic enters the market it has a different shape and color than its brand-name counterpart. The same holds true for drugs whose price has been negotiated and internationally traded according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations. The varied colors and shapes of generics are meant to deter counterfeit medications from entering the market and being traded domestically and abroad. Although the number of counterfeit medications maybe decreased, the variations in pills often&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/health/12pills.html"">prevent the elderly</a>, who are on a number of prescriptions, from adhering to medication guidelines. Thus, is this solution properly addressing the issue at hand? Is the tradeoff of decreased counterfeit activity worth the risk of compromising the health and safety of the elderly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: Missing Medication Guides</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As described above, safety concerns are paramount in the drug development arena, but have increasingly crept into marketing and pharmacies. According to an<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/news/20110628/some-drugs-sold-without-safety-information"">&nbsp;investigation</a>&nbsp;conducted by Consumer Reports, pharmacies often do not include federally mandated medication guides with filled prescriptions and when the safety information is provided, it is often varied and conflicting. A major driver behind the inconsistency is the lack of a nationwide standard, similar to the Drug Facts labels on over-the-counter medications. Instead, rules are developed and set by each individual state’s pharmacy board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution: Patient Responsibility</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although legislation or regulations have yet to be introduced, one can hope that the results of this investigation will propel lawmakers to devise recommendations that will not only standardize medication guides and language, but also ensure that federally mandated medication guides are included for designated medications. Until lawmakers turn their attention to this safety issue, the responsibility will remain with the consumer. An informed patient is the key component to realizing adherence and guaranteeing safety, but is too much responsibility being placed on the consumer? The pharmacy should be accountable for following regulations and distributing proper safety information.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Noting that last&nbsp;spring, leaders of the health care industry, including representatives from PhARMA, America's Health Insurance Plans, the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association, met with President Obama and pledged to him and the American people that they would decrease the annual rate of cost increases by 1.5 percentage points to save $2 trillion or more over the next decade. Neas said the commitment that industry leaders made to the President and the American public ""should be more than a photo op, press statement and promise."" Citing Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus'&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/15/AR2009121503381.html?wpisrc=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=newsletter"">piece about legislative cost containment efforts</a>&nbsp;and needing a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that the rate of health care inflation is slowed, Neas urged that industry pledges to the President and the American people to control the growth of national health expenditures be codified and made enforceable as part of health reform.</p>

773,"Rother: President’s Constructive Rx Plan Should Catalyze Broader Debate","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by NCHC President and CEO John Rother on President Trump’s plan to address rising prescription drug prices</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care has focused on rising drug costs as a key driver of unsustainable increases in the cost of healthcare for American consumers, employers, and taxpayers.&nbsp;<strong>The President today embraced some important, constructive ideas. We hope today’s speech will be a catalyst for a broader, more bipartisan debate about even more effective alternatives.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The President’s plan takes useful steps toward to a more rational drug market: demanding price transparency in drug ads and promoting competition from lower-cost biosimilar and generic alternatives. But if progress stops there, we will fail to adequately constrain costs for most consumers or for the healthcare system as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today’s policy blueprint would not have prevented the two most notorious instances of price gouging – the introduction of Sovaldi at a price of $1000 per pill, and the actions of Martin Shkreli in suddenly raising the price of the brand name drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 because his company was the sole remaining producer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is a crisis. The twenty most prescribed drugs in Medicare Part D increased ten times the rate of inflation over the last five years. Some drugs are so prohibitively expensive that patients can’t afford them. Building on the good ideas advanced today, we need to work together, across parties and across sectors, to develop a national strategy that is commensurate with the scale of this crisis.</p>

776,"Rother: Final Tax Bill would Undercut Affordability of Care and Coverage","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by National Coalition on Health Care&nbsp;President and CEO John Rother on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate penalties included in final House and Senate tax legislation</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“More than just a tax bill, the legislation before Congress this week would undermine health coverage and affordability in the United States. Repealing individual mandate penalties without replacement would leave millions of Americans without health coverage while doing nothing to address the cost of health care.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In fact, far from providing relief to health care consumers, enactment of this legislation would saddle Congress and the President with two pressing legislative imperatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First, Congressional leaders will either have to strike a bipartisan, 60-Senate-vote dealwaiving the pay-as-you-go law or subject Medicare and its 67 million beneficiaries to $25 billion in automatic cuts next year. That’s a tall order for a Congress that can’t find a way to extend universally-supported children’s health insurance or community health center programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Second, substantial new federal spending will be required to keep private, individually-purchased insurance as a viable option for many – absent the individual mandate.&nbsp;The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the repeal of the ACA’s individual mandate penalties included in the tax bill, would increase premiums in the non-group insurance market by 10 percent and leave 4 million uninsured in 2018 and 13 million uninsured by 2027. Particularly for the middle-income earners or self-employed who receive little or no ACA subsidies, substantial new federal reinsurance dollars will be needed in the short term. Over the long-term, ongoing risk stabilization becomes essential – either through federally-run programs or federally-funded state-run programs. The magnitude of the needed investments dwarf those contemplated under the proposed Collins-Nelson legislation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For Congressional leaders and the Administration, these new realities will prove bitter pills to swallow.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
777,"Rother Calls AHCA Failure Positive for Healthcare","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The failure of the House of Representatives to pass its ACA repeal and replace&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;is positive for healthcare and for the health and&nbsp;financial security of all Americans.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We hope Congress will now abandon efforts to&nbsp;advance any bill&nbsp;that shifts hundreds of billions in&nbsp;federal&nbsp;Medicaid costs onto states and beneficiaries or&nbsp;leaves tens of millions fewer Americans with coverage – as&nbsp;this one would have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is, however, still much that must and can be done to address costs that are far too high both for the federal budget and for individuals. The National Coalition on Health Care, which is made up of more than 90 major organizations representing providers, payers, and patients, believes that bipartisan progress toward improving the value of our health system is still possible.&nbsp;In particular, we urge&nbsp;Congress and the Administration&nbsp;to address the unsustainable&nbsp;high costs of prescription drugs, the need to better coordinate care for our sickest patients – those with multiple chronic conditions, and the importance of strengthening programs for disease prevention and population health.&nbsp;The stakes are too high to further delay constructive&nbsp;measures that can make healthcare more affordable.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Supreme Court could make our health cost problems worse if its ruling slows cost control efforts already underway or swells the rank of uninsured Americans. Even if it doesn’t, the underlying challenges will remain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Private sector per capita health costs are climbing at nearly three times the overall rate of inflation, cutting into businesses’ bottom lines and eating into families’ incomes. Although costs in Medicare and Medicaid are growing at a somewhat slower rate, the Congressional Budget Office still identifies that growth as the greatest single threat to our nation’s fiscal future. The expiration of tax provisions, a $128 billion Medicare sequester, a scheduled 30 percent payment reduction for providers and the federal debt limit ensure that Congress will take some action in coming months. The question is what.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This moment demands new action to confront the rising tide of health costs, not the shifting of federal costs onto beneficiaries, states or the private sector. It’s time providers put aside today’s broken fee-for-service payment system and transitioned to new, coordinated models of care. It’s time consumers take more responsibility for improving their health, seek out information on the cost and quality of treatments and providers, and be ready to pay a little more if they don’t. Finally, it’s time our elected leaders found the courage to work together on achievable, common-ground policies that enhance competition in health care markets, curb waste in public programs, and adjust a range of agricultural, education, taxation and medical liability policies that contribute to high health costs.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care applauds you for seeking “recommendations along the continuum that spans from addressing the root causes that lead to, or fail to prevent, opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders to improving access to and quality of treatment.” This letter outlines NCHC’s initial recommendations, responsive to this request.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC&nbsp;is&nbsp;a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing more than 80 participating organizations, including medical societies, businesses, unions, health care providers, faith-based associations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, minorities,&nbsp;and persons with disabilities.&nbsp;The Coalition is committed to advancing - through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy – an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in general are exacting an enormous toll in lives and in increased economic burden. In 2016, 64,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses alone,<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn1"">[i]</a>&nbsp;a horrifying level of impact that could well be eclipsed by longer-term increases in other SUD-related sources of mortality. According to the Altarum Institute, the combined economic costs of substance abuse since 2001 have exceeded $1 trillion, inclusive of health spending as well as lost wages and productivity. $500 billion in additional costs are expected within the next three years alone – if the epidemic remains on its current course.<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn2"">[ii]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, turning the tide will not be easy. The roots of this crisis are complex, and any successful response must be multifaceted. Providers, payers, and public programs should be re-examining their practices and policies to promote adherence to CDC guidelines regarding opioid use, namely that opioids should not be routine or first- line treatments for chronic pain and that prescriptions should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Effective public health and prevention initiatives, alternatives to addictive pain medications, and affordable access to treatment are also indispensable. &nbsp;Finally, any cost-effective strategy must look beyond health care and policing, toward the employment, housing, and educational opportunities that are associated with lower rates of substance abuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Successfully implementing such a strategy will take time. It will require sustained leadership across the public and private sectors over a period of years. But these facts only make it more urgent that policymakers lay the foundation for success now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC recommends the following immediate steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Implement the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act’s (CARA’s) Lock-In Provisions:&nbsp;Of the 98 million Americans who take prescription opioids each year, almost 3 million receive their prescriptions from 5 to as many as 20 different physicians.<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn3"">[iii]</a>&nbsp;Section 704 of CARA allows Medicare Part D plans to implement a drug management program for at-risk beneficiaries.&nbsp; NCHC supports prompt implementation of this important reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Require Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances:&nbsp; Inappropriate prescribing of opioid drugs has played a well-documented role in the current crisis.<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn4"">[iv]</a>&nbsp;Certain non-opioid medications that interact with opioids like gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines are driving increased overdoses.<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn5"">[v]</a>&nbsp;Tracking prescriptions and prescribing patterns is a necessary first step toward preventing this kind of avoidable public health emergency in the future. Unfortunately, permitting paper prescriptions opens the door to abuse, diversion, and fraud. NCHC supports HR 3528,&nbsp;<em>the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act</em>, which requires electronic prescribing for controlled substances under Medicare Part D.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Encourage Integration of Behavioral Health with Primary Care: &nbsp;In the United States, the specialty behavioral health infrastructure and workforce is simply too small to successfully address today’s epidemic alone. Evidence-based prevention, screening, assessment, and treatment for both substance use disorders and comorbid mental health conditions must be fully integrated with the rest of health care, particularly primary care. As the first and 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;largest payers for care, Medicare and Medicaid must support and encourage this integration. Evidence-based SUD interventions, like Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) and Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT), should be more broadly available through better integration between primary care and behavioral health. To that end, we support</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>establishing incentives for additional physicians, nurse practitioners, clinical pharmacists and physician assistants to receive training in these interventions;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>providing additional, targeted funding for the development, testing, and endorsement of meaningful performance measures related to behavioral health/primary care integration, inclusive of SUD screening and treatment;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>incorporating strong behavioral health metrics into existing CMS performance measurement initiatives, in coordination with other payers and multi-payer measure alignment efforts like the Core Measures Collaborative; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>permitting Federally Qualified Health Centers and other providers to bill state Medicaid programs for both behavioral and physical health care visits on the same day.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We encourage the Committee to work with CMS and the states to assure immediate administrative action wherever possible, and pursue prompt legislative solutions if necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reform of the Medicaid Institutes of Mental Disease (IMD) Payment Exclusion: &nbsp;An outdated provision of the 1965 federal law establishing Medicaid bars state Medicaid programs from covering adult inpatient or residential addiction treatment in facilities with more than 16 psychiatric beds. Recent Medicaid guidance now allows managed care plans to furnish up to fifteen days of treatment per month in lieu of other Medicaid-covered services,<a href=""https://nchc.org/recommendations-for-senate-finance-regarding-substance-use-disorders/#_edn6"">[vi]</a>&nbsp;and a handful states have received waivers to cover SUD treatment on a broader basis. However, when an epidemic of substance abuse is sweeping the nation, an update to the underlying statute is urgently needed. NCHC supports S. 1169,&nbsp;<em>the Medicaid CARES Act,</em>&nbsp;which would give all states the option of covering adult residential treatment as part of a full continuum of SUD services.&nbsp; Facilities would have to be accredited, with an average number of no more than 40 beds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We greatly appreciate that you have sought out stakeholders’ input as you craft legislative responses to this pressing national crisis. Please do not hesitate to contact NCHC’s Policy Director, Larry McNeely, at&nbsp;lmcneely@nchc.org&nbsp;if you have questions regarding this letter or related issues.</p>

<p>More Americans comparison-shop for their auto mechanics than for their doctors. Yet, prices for health care services vary greatly within geographic areas and are not consistently linked to quality. This indicates that if consumers were empowered to choose high value providers and services, they could receive better care and save money. Within the U.S., the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health savings accounts along with continued upward price trends makes it imperative for consumers to spend their health care dollars wisely. Lack of price and quality transparency presents a major barrier to consumer engagement. Access to information is only a first step, though. Value-based insurance design, which aligns consumers’ incentives with value, can further improve health care outcomes and affordability.</p>

<p>Currently, more Americans comparison-shop for their auto mechanics than for their doctors. Yet, prices vary greatly within geographic areas and are not consistently linked to quality. This indicates that if consumers were empowered to choose high-value providers and services, they could receive better care and save money. Within the U.S., the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plans and health savings accounts along with continued upward price trends makes it imperative for consumers to spend their health care dollars wisely. Lack of price and quality transparency presents a major barrier to consumer engagement. Access to information is only a first step, though. Value-based insurance design, which aligns consumers’ incentives with value, can further improve health care outcomes and affordability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health Care Quality and Price Transparency<br></strong>Individual consumers lack the information they need on the price and quality of medical services. With the following steps, we can begin to enhance transparency and provide all of us with better data to inform our health care choices:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Support the efforts of plans, employers, and others to offer online tools that allow consumers to comparison-shop on both price and quality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Promote the movement toward parsimonious sets of core outcome measures, in Medicare and across payers. (while retaining flexibility to address the needs of certain specialties and covered populations)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure the broadest possible provider participation by minimizing the reporting burden, by incorporating advanced registry or EHR-based measures and by permitting small practices to join together in ‘virtual groups’ for purposes of quality measurement, reporting, and improvement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID)<br></strong>Consumers who seek out the highest value care should have a chance to realize financial savings. Value-based insurance design (VBID) bases cost-sharing on quality and value rather than price, reducing cost-sharing for health care services with demonstrated high value. VBID programs have achieved increased utilization of high-value services and prescriptions, produced better health outcomes for enrollees, and in some cases, generated cost savings.&nbsp;The following adjustments to current law and regulations would allow millions to benefit from value-based insurance:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enable Medicare Advantage plans, as well as Accountable Care Organizations, to reduce copays for high-value providers and services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit consumer-directed health plans in the private market to cover certain evidence-based, high-value services – such as podiatric foot exams and metformin for diabetics – prior to the exhaustion of the deductible.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How people approach the end of life has changed greatly in recent years, but medical care at the end of life still proceeds in much the same way. Medical advances allow people to be kept alive even as their bodies become extremely frail, pushing back the limit beyond which health care is certain to have no power to extend life. Changes in decision making have not kept pace with these technological advances, so that end of life care often does not live up to its potential of enabling each person to face aging and death with dignity. We need to reexamine how people’s goals and preferences can be reflected in their medical care.</p>

<p><strong>Web Resource Evaluation:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John H. Renner, MD</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Date of Review: March 17, 1997</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a very disturbing and challenging website that should be read by anyone concerned with health care issues. It is not a large site, but is powerful in its content. The introduction states: ""The National Coalition of Health Care is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care. Rigorously nonpartisan, the Coalition is comprised of almost 100 groups, employing or representing approximately 100 million Americans and united in the belief that we need -- and can achieve -- better, more affordable, and more equitable health care for all Americans.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition membership is listed and should be viewed before reading reports. The five goals are clearly stated and are very reasonable:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Securing health insurance for all;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improved quality of car;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cost containment;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Equitable financing; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Simplified administration.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve these goals, The National Coalition on Health Care has done a survey, commissioned papers by leading researchers, held public forums, and published the results. There are two papers on this website that are mandatory reading for an informed consumer, physician, administrator, or health insurance executive. The papers are: ""How Americans Perceive the Health Care System: A Report on a National Survey,"" and ""The Nation's Least Understood Health Care Problem -- The Quality of Medical Care.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The summary of the latter, very well-referenced article states: ""We have described some troubling aspects about the quality of healthcare. At the same time, it is important to point out that there is good news as well, and reason to be hopeful. We have learned a great deal about how to address this problem, and we know that achieving higher quality can lower costs. We know how to conduct outcomes research and how to develop practice guidelines. We know how to bring together private researchers to conduct this work and how to develop better standards of care.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The conclusion of the survey states: ""Concerns raised by those polled were system-wide, relating to quality of care delivered, cost of health care and accessibility of care for the average American. While those surveyed had confidence in their personal health care delivery, there was a notable lack of confidence in the health care system at large. These anxieties crossed gender, political, age, economic and regional boundaries. Additionally, there is a widely help perception that the future of health care does not look good -- there is little confidence that the quality of health care delivery can be improved or that health care will be available to the average American.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This doomsday-like perception is the essence of the disturbing nature of this website. However, the stated goals are optimistic as well as realistic. If medicine listens to its critics and its own statesmen, change will occur for the better. Websites like this one help improve healthcare for all of us.</p>

<p><strong>FACTS ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Quality is doing the right thing right the first time.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are widespread problems with the quality of much of America's health care. Although a trillion and a half dollars a year are spent on medical care, many people are receiving more care than they need, many are receiving less than they need, and many are receiving the wrong kind of care. In addition, preventable and harmful errors are occurring frequently. Millions of Americans are injured and tens of thousands die unnecessarily each year because of medical errors. Moreover, these problems are not being recognized or addressed adequately in this country today. We must find a better way to measure and improve quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The type of medical services a patient receives often depends on whether the patient has health insurance. The second most significant factor is where the patient is treated. And quality does not consist only - or even mainly - of consumers being able to see the provider of their choice when and where they want to see them. Quality is receiving the right care, in the right setting, at the right time.<strong>HIGH ERROR RATES</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Institute of Medicine estimates that nearly 100,000 patients die in hospitals each year due to medical errors. This number does not include deaths that occur in the ambulatory setting or deaths after discharge that resulted from medical errors when the patient was hospitalized. This is three times the number who die on the highways. (Source: Institute of Medicine {IOM}).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Total national costs (lost income, lost household production, disability and health care costs) of preventable adverse events (medical errors resulting in injury) are estimated to be $35 billion a year (IOM).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In terms of lives lost, patient safety is as important an issue as worker safety. Every year, over 6,000 Americans die from workplace injuries. Medication errors alone, occurring in or out of the hospital, are estimated to account for over 7,000 deaths annually (IOM).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>High error rates are reported in a wide range of medical practices, with serious, sometimes fatal, consequences. For example, autopsy studies show high rates -- 35-40% -- of missed diagnoses, often resulting in death.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Harvard Medical Practice Study reported that 4% of hospitalized patients suffered an injury due to treatment and that two-thirds of these were caused by errors. Extrapolating to the nation as a whole, it was estimated that approximately 1 million Americans are injured by errors in treatment in hospitals each year.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Careful reviews in two outstanding teaching hospitals found serious or potentially serious medication errors in almost 7 patients out of every 100 admissions (Source: Journal of the American Medical Association).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that two million patients each year contract infections while undergoing treatment in U.S. hospitals. The rate of such hospital-based infections increased 36% between 1975 and 1995. Some 90,000 of those who are infected die as a result of the infection.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A 1995 study that examined adverse reactions to medications found that some 28% of all such reactions were preventable and 42% of those that were life-threatening were preventable.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Drugs called beta-blockers are a widely recommended treatment for many heart attack victims. In a 1997 study of Medicare patients in New Jersey, only 21% of those who had had a heart attack received beta blockers within 90 days of their heart attack. Those receiving the drugs had a 43% lower rate of mortality than those who did not (Journal of the American Medical Association).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Aspirin is an advised treatment for most heart attack victims. It reduces the risk of blood clots. In a 1995 study of Medicare patients in four states who had experienced heart attacks, only 61% received aspirin within the first two days of hospitalization (Journal of the American Medical Association).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Diabetes causes several complications that are less likely to occur with proper medical care. One of these is an eye condition that can result in blindness. It is recommended that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes have an annual eye exam starting five years after diagnosis. Patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes should have the exam annually starting at the time of diagnosis. In a national study, only 49% of adults with either type of diabetes had had an eye exam in the past year.</li>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Overuse of antibiotics is a serious problem in medicine. It can lead to the development of strains of bacteria that are resistant to available antibiotics. Antibiotics are almost never an appropriate treatment for people with a common cold because most colds are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are ineffective. But in a 1996 study of Medicaid beneficiaries diagnosed with a cold in Kentucky, 60% filled a prescription for an antibiotic (Source: Journal of the American Medical Association).</li>

<p><strong>Future Challenges</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts in the field of quality assurance believe that the American health care delivery system is in need of fundamental change if we are to achieve major improvements in health care quality. They stress that the current care systems cannot do the job; but changing systems of care will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Key challenges include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>- Redesigning care processes based on best practices- Using evidence-based medicine to improve clinical practice- Using information technologies to improve access to clinical information and support clinical decision making- Coordination of care across patient conditions, services, and settings over time- Incorporation of performance and outcome measurements for improvement and accountability</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time for our nation and its leaders to devote themselves to achieving for the public the improvements in performance - error reduction, patient safety, identification of what works best, service enhancements, and waste reduction - which will enable Americans to have the care they deserve at the cost they can afford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
1008,"Putting a Spotlight on Misdiagnosis","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a recent Institutes of Medicine report, clamor for reform of the delivery and payment of health care has all but ignored a crucial aspect of patient care: diagnosis. But after the report’s authors got top billing in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s December 15 issue, we are one step closer to giving this issue the attention it deserves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because diagnosis serves as the starting point for all subsequent health care decisions, arriving at an accurate diagnosis is crucial for patient safety. &nbsp;The IOM report—titled “Improving Diagnosis in Health Care”—estimates that diagnostic errors account for up to 17 percent of hospital adverse events and are implicated in 10 percent of patient deaths. Most Americans will be misdiagnosed at least once in their lifetime. And, as healthcare becomes more complex, IOM researchers predict that incidence of diagnostic errors will likely rise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IOM report urges the healthcare industry to commit to a concerted effort to address diagnostic error. And it offers a few fundamental strategies towards this aim: targeting training and education for healthcare professionals; improving teamwork among healthcare providers, patients, and families; creating a payment and care delivery environment that supports the diagnostic process; and focusing on research related to diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improving teamwork is particularly crucial for better diagnosis. Effective diagnosis depends upon effective collaboration between patients, families, and health care professionals with different educational and training backgrounds. Teamwork between clinicians may be difficult when the diagnostic process unfolds across different settings or takes place in a frenzied environment.&nbsp; In emergency room settings, for instance, doctors, nurses, and technicians must multi-task and work together to arrive at a diagnosis amidst a constant stream of new patients and information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In confronting these challenges, the IOM report urges health care organizations to facilitate teamwork in the diagnostic process, ensuring that all health care professionals have the knowledge, skills, resources, and support to collaborate effectively and in a timely manner. The IOM committee also suggests educational approaches, such as adding diagnostic skills training to professional school curricula and developing certification and accreditation programs that reinforce and evaluate those skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Payment and care delivery models also influence the diagnostic process and the occurrence of diagnostic errors. The committee notes that current fee-for-service payment systems incentivize procedure-oriented care and divert attention from tasks in diagnosis, such as performing a thorough clinical history, interview, and physical exam. The report proposes changes to fee-for-service payment to improve collaboration and emphasize tasks in the diagnostic process. For example, the committee recommends that&nbsp; Medicare, Medicaid, and other payers extend coverage for evaluation activities that are not currently coded or covered, such as time spent by pathologists and radiologists in advising physicians on testing for specific patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The report goes on to assert that diagnostic errors have been a “blind spot” in the delivery of quality health care at least in part because of a lack of available data and research. In the IOM’s view, reducing the prevalence of misdiagnosis will require collecting information about its occurrence and learning from these errors to implement necessary changes. The report suggests that health care organizations can encourage professionals to identify and learn from errors by promoting a non-punitive work culture. Additionally, the IOM committee urges federal agencies to develop a coordinated research agenda on the diagnostic process by the end of 2016 and commit dedicated funding to it. &nbsp;Diagnostic errors represent a complex challenge, and specific interventions must be rigorously evaluated for efficacy and safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifteen years ago, the landmark IOM report, “To Err is Human,” began a crucial discussion about patient safety within the health care community and spurred subsequent health care quality reform efforts. Here’s hoping that this IOM report sparks a similar revolution when it comes to medical diagnosis.</p>

1010,"Modernize Medicare Provider Payment","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifty-five million Americans&nbsp;<em>–</em>&nbsp;including seniors, disabled citizens and patients facing ALS and end-stage renal disease&nbsp;<em>–&nbsp;</em>depend on Medicare. Medicare payments to providers and plans total nearly $600 billion per year, totaled $620 billion in 2014, accounting for 20% of our $3 trillion in national health expenditures and 14% of the federal budget. Improving Medicare payment is a high stakes endeavor for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, a close look at Medicare spending reveals an opportunity to deliver better care at lower cost. The data show substantial variation among regions and among providers in the volume of services provided, without a clear relationship to care quality or patient health out­comes. Changing Medicare’s reimbursement policies can facilitate the spread of higher-value care across the country. And because Medicare, the largest payer for health care in the United States, has historically served as a catalyst and a template for private sector provider reimbursement changes, improving Medicare payment practices can also promote positive change in the rest of the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Expand and Refine Successful Alternative Payment Models<br></strong>Alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), bundled payments and advanced primary care models are already delivering on the promise of better care at lower costs.&nbsp;To realize that promise for more Medicare beneficiaries and ensure the Medicare program receives the maximum benefit from these new models, NCHC recommends that policy makers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand the use of bundled payments as evidence accumulates about the conditions for which they are effective—while maintaining strong consumer protections.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Give ACOs flexibility to tailor care to the needs of beneficiaries by waiving those payment and benefit regulations originally designed to restrain volume in the fee-for-service payment environment. Additionally, transition to savings targets based on regional spending instead of individual providers’ past performance, to encourage the most efficient providers to continue to participate.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand advanced primary care and medical home models when proven successful</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure that federal policy supports the development of the next generation of alternative payment models, NCHC strongly supports the preservation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s existing authority and funding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Reform Medicare’s Legacy Reimbursement Systems<br></strong>Any serious attempt at reform cannot stop with the promotion of alternative payment models. Over 25 million beneficiaries are neither enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan nor have their care coordinated through a Medicare ACO or CMMI advanced primary care payment model. In addition, traditional Medicare’s reimbursement policies and rates remain critical components of the payment formulae for the MA plans, ACOs, and alternative payment models now undergoing testing at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).&nbsp;NCHC supports the following improvements:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<p>The best way to curb the cost of treating disease is to keep people from getting sick in the first place.&nbsp; Yet increased rates of obesity in all demographic subgroups have contributed to an increased burden of costly diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and cancer throughout the entire health system. At the same time, the enormous progress since the 1960s in reducing tobacco use has plateaued, leaving the United States with 42.1 million adult smokers and a 15.7% smoking rate among high schoolers—a trend that is increasingly driven by highly marketed alternatives to cigarettes such as small cigars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obesity-related and tobacco-related illnesses impose $190 billion and $170 billion, respectively, in costs on our already strapped health care system. Fortunately, these costs and those attributable to a range of other health challenges are largely preventable. NCHC supports the following prevention strategies:</p>

<p>QUALITY IMPROVEMENT GRANT WILL HELP DISSEMINATE ""BEST PRACTICES"" IN HEALTH CARE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a grant to the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) to disseminate widely information on what constitutes ""best practices"" in four areas of medical care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the grant, that over a two-year period could total almost $600,000, the two organizations initially will conduct meetings and seminars on what can be done to improve the quality of care by reducing medical errors and in providing appropriate care at the end of life. In addition, the project will identify best practices in cardiac care and chronic disease management, and those practices will be added to the areas covered in the meetings held in the second year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effort being supported by AHRQ is unique in that it will focus on helping to change the way health care services are delivered by educating those who pay for and receive care, such as employers, unions, and consumers, as well as the providers of care. The meetings will not only identify what are known to be more efficient and efficacious treatments in the four subject areas but also will provide the various audiences with information on how they can aid in the introduction or enhancement of those treatments within their health care communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We believe that positive changes in our health care system can be accelerated through the broad involvement of all parties in that system,"" said Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., president of NCHC. ""That's why we launched the 'Accelerating Change Today (A.C.T.) Initiative - For America's Health' with IHI two years ago. We have produced two reports profiling institutions and organizations that have made significant improvements in reducing medical errors and in end-of-life care. With the assistance from AHRQ, we can continue and expand our efforts in that initiative,"" he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""This grant will allow us to look at a number of avenues for implementing change and to evaluate those avenues in determining how best to bring about improvements in the quality of care,"" said Donald M. Berwick, M.D., M.P.P., IHI's co-founder and president. ""We know how to do many of the things necessary to improve care, but the challenge is to see that those things actually are done throughout the health care system,"" he pointed out.</p>

<p>The National Coalition is the nation's largest, most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care system. Its members include large and small businesses, unions, consumer, provider and religious groups. Its Honorary Co-Chairs are former Presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford. Former Governor Robert D. Ray (R-IA) and Former Congressman Paul G. Rogers (D-FL) serve as Co-Chairs of the Coalition.</p>

<p>REPORT HIGHLIGHTS IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF CARE AT THE END OF LIFE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quality of care provided to dying patients can be dramatically improved, as illustrated by the nine institutions and organizations profiled in a new report, Promises to Keep: Changing the Way We Provide Care at the End of Life, released today by the National Coalition on Health Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the 2.4 million people in the United States who die each year, many suffer pain and other distress that could be prevented or relieved with existing knowledge, programs and therapies. Almost 50% of conscious, hospitalized patients have serious pain in the days before death. About one-third of people live at least part of their final year in nursing homes, but only about one-third of nursing home residents with serious pain receive any relief from their pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The report provides examples of what has been done in our health care system -- and which should be replicated throughout the country -- to avoid the pain, fear and confusion that too often faces patients and their families at the end of life,"" according to Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., president of the National Coalition on Health Care. ""The programs profiled have focused on better pain management, continuity of care, serving the needs of families, and assisting in the grieving process -- all of which are part of the quality of care at the end of life that all Americans should receive,"" he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We see the dramatic results that innovative programs in end-of-life care can achieve for patients and their families,"" said Donald M. Berwick, M.D., M.P.P., president and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.. ""The challenge, now, is to ensure that similar programs are available to all dying patients,"" he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team selecting the programs to be profiled in this report was headed by Joanne Lynn, M.D., president of the Americans for Better Care of the Dying and director of RAND's Center to Improve Care of the Dying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The innovative programs highlighted in the report:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

1022,"Census Uninsured Data","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AMERICA'S UNINSURED: HOW MANY ARE TOO MANY?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following statement was released today by Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., president of the National Coalition on Health Care:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""The U.S. Census Bureau today released data that show that the number of uninsured in this country dropped last year from 44.3 million to 42.6 million, a decrease of 1.7 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Our concern, however, is that this rate of decrease may be a one-time phenomenon, and will not continue if and when the country experiences an economic downturn or if the cost of health insurance continues to rise at the current rates (which are averaging 9% to 14% annually.) In addition, we still have more than 42 million Americans who do not have health insurance. Where are the proposals and programs that are going to provide those people with health insurance? And if we are able to reduce those who are uninsured by a similar number each year, how long will it take before all Americans have health insurance that will enable them to obtain quality, affordable health care?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""The issue of the uninsured is not only an economic one, but also a moral and ethical one. In a country as rich as ours, how can we justify leaving millions of Americans without health insurance and with its attendant consequences? Is this 1.7 million decrease in the uninsured as good as it gets? How many uninsured are too many?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Many children became uninsured when welfare reform removed their families' eligibility for Medicaid. Federal and state agencies and many private groups have worked very hard to see that those children who were still eligible for Medicaid or for the Children Health Insurance Program were enrolled in those programs. That has increased the number of children with health insurance, and we applaud those efforts. In addition, in the extraordinary economy we have experienced over the past several years, with its increased profits and tighter job markets, more employers have offered health insurance to their employees. This, too, has helped reduce the number of uninsured, particularly among low income workers.""</p>

<p><strong>""A Perfect Storm: The Confluence of Forces Affecting Health Care Coverage""</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>November 15, 2001</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good Afternoon and thank you for joining us for this briefing on the state of our nation's health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The views you will be hearing are those of the National Coalition on Health Care - which is the nation's largest and most broadly representative alliance working to understand and to address the serious problems in our health care system. Our Coalition is rigorously non-partisan and has always carried out its decade-long work in a ""no-fault"" manner. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford honor us as Honorary Co-chairs and our Co-chairs are former Republican Governor Robert D. Ray of Iowa and former Democratic Congressman Paul G. Rogers of Florida. Our 80 members are listed in your handouts and include major corporations, the nation's largest consumer, provider and labor groups, as well as all the nation's major religious faiths. Our members relate to, represent or employ over 100 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The principles we have long supported are listed on this chart and a description of their rationale is contained in your packets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a long period of intensive analysis, we have concluded that our health care system has three serious and interrelated problems - rising costs, decreasing coverage, and very serious and pervasive quality problems. We have further concluded that systemic problems of this magnitude cannot be solved by a ""patch work"" strategy and that 40 years of national experience attests to the bankruptcy of such an approach. In fact, we will soon be releasing a separate study which establishes and quantifies the shortcomings of a piecemeal approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of you are probably familiar with the national best selling book ""The Perfect Storm"", which chronicles the formation and unleashing of the most powerful storm in this century. It occurred because of the unprecedented confluence of nature's most awesome forces. As with most storms there were warnings, and those who ignored those warnings lost their lives. We are here today to report that a Perfect Storm has now formed in our health care system. But unlike nature's storm, this one will not abate in short order. In fact, there is no end in sight, and there is reason to expect ever increasing intensity and damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will show today that the set of circumstances we now face is unprecedented. Never in our history have we faced this number of forces and of this magnitude simultaneously. If unaddressed, the consequences will be devastating to tens of millions of Americans and to our society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real tragedy here is that none of the tools we are currently using -- or currently contemplating - including a Patient's Bill of Rights, tax changes or MSA's -- have even a remote chance of successfully addressing our problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, this storm has been brewing for some time, long before the economic downturn and the events of September 11th. For example, we have long known that even a robust economy will not solve our large and chronic problem of the uninsured. Despite a decade of the most vibrant economy in recent history, more than five million people were added to the ranks of the uninsured. Long before September 11th, we were warned that our nation has no plan to meet the health care needs of our 77 million baby boomers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long before the economic downturn and September 11th, we were warned by the Institute of Medicine and others that our health care system was ""broken"" and needed comprehensive restructuring and major improvement. More than two years ago, we were warned by the President's Quality Commission that our health care system was plagued with errors and with overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services. As a result, millions of preventable injuries and over 100,000 deaths occurred yearly. Months ago, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill warned a Senate hearing that because of our lack of attention to quality, our nation was wasting 30-50% of the 1.3 trillion dollars we were spending in health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than a year ago, and at a time of unprecedented budget surpluses, the CBO warned that rising health care costs were the largest single force that was going to drive our nation back into unsustainable budget deficits and that this would continue unless major changes were made at every level in health care. And finally, though we have long known that delivery system consolidation would make it even harder to get desirable competition into our system, consolidation has proceeded at an accelerated pace. And despite all these warnings, very little was done to prepare for the storm which is now upon us. We believe our nation and our people are about to pay a heavy price for such inaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For what has suddenly changed is that, on top of these existing major problems, new and even more powerful forces have been laid which will have devastating consequences. These include health care premiums that are expected to increase five times the rate of general inflation -- the greatest margin of increase in our history -- and a serious economic recession, with resultant major increases in the number of unemployed and uninsured. And now, layered over these forces, we face international terrorism which could suddenly impact the health of tens of millions of our citizens. Never have we seen such forces converge on our society and never before have they posed such a threat to the middle class. We believe our nation and our political leaders must again return to dealing with this transcendent domestic crisis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So with this as background, we now want to share with you the data behind our conclusions and our projections of the impact these forces will have on the American people and our economy. I want to stress that the projections you will hear use ""Best Case Scenarios"" and are very conservative. We actually feel the problems could become far worse than our projections.</p>

<p>As Election Day 2016 approaches, it is time to take a look at the candidate’s health care proposals.&nbsp; Although this issue has not played an especially prominent role recently in either Hillary Clinton’s or Donald Trump’s campaigns–although it was briefly discussed the October 9 debate–it is certainly an issue of importance to many Americans, and will continue to be so well after the election is over.</p>

<p>As Election Day 2016 approaches, it is time to take a look at the candidate’s health care proposals.&nbsp; Although this issue has not played an especially prominent role recently in either Hillary Clinton’s or Donald Trump’s campaigns–although it was briefly discussed the October 9 debate–it is certainly an issue of importance to many Americans, and will continue to be so well after the election is over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Commonwealth Fund recently released a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/other/2016/sep/2016-candidates-health-proposals"">report</a>&nbsp;comparing the two candidate’s health care proposals and not surprisingly, there are stark differences between their two approaches.&nbsp; In short, Clinton wants to keep the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but make needed changes; her proposals would&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the number of people with health insurance by 400,000 to 9.6 million.&nbsp; Trump would repeal and replace the ACA with a proposal entitled “Healthcare Reform to Make America Great&nbsp;Again;” it would&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;the number of people with health insurance by 15.6 million to 25.1 million.&nbsp; Both Clinton’s and Trump’s proposals have an impact on the deficit of course; the Commonwealth Fund has estimated that the impact of Clinton’s proposals could range from a $0.7 billion reduction in the deficit to a $90 billion increase.&nbsp; They estimate that the Trump proposals would increase the deficit by $0.5 billion to $41 billion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Commonwealth Fund’s report focuses on four aspects of Clinton’s plan that focus on affordability of coverage and on increasing the number of people with insurance.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the most well-known – and possibly the most controversial — of her proposals would create a so-called “public-option” in the ACA marketplaces that would compete with private plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her plan would also create a cost-sharing refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 per individual and $5,000 per family to offset the cost of out-of-pocket spending on health care – including premiums, co-pays and coinsurance —&nbsp; that exceeds 5 percent of income; this would be available to anyone enrolled in private coverage. &nbsp;Clinton would also reduce the maximum premium contribution that individuals must make to purchase insurance in the marketplace.&nbsp; Today, the maximum is 9.66 percent of income; her plan would reduce that to 8.5 percent for people at 400 percent of poverty, with lower limits at lower income levels.&nbsp; Finally, her plan would fix the “family glitch” by giving families access to ACA premium tax credits if the contribution for family coverage exceeds 8.5 percent (currently “affordability” is tied to cheaper individual coverage, not family coverage).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump’s proposals with regard to insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs would, in addition to repealing and replacing the ACA, allow individuals to fully deduct insurance premium payments on their federal tax returns.&nbsp; In other words, it would allow people to purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars, which is currently only available for employer-sponsored insurance. &nbsp;This proposal would ameliorate the impact of repealing the ACA on the number of uninsured to some extent.&nbsp; &nbsp;His plan would also block grant Medicaid; the Commonwealth Fund assumes his plan would also block grant CHIP.&nbsp; The block grant would likely be based on pre-ACA (i.e., pre-expansion) spending.&nbsp; Finally, Trump would promote the sale of health insurance plans across state lines.&nbsp; In other words, health insurers could sell plans in a state without complying with that state’s insurance regulations and requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the fourth open enrollment period approaches with attendant higher premiums for 2017, it is certainly possible that health care will play a bigger role in the upcoming Presidential election.&nbsp; But even if it does not become a central theme in the debate, it is certain that health care, and ever growing health care costs, will remain a primary issue for many Americans.&nbsp; And we hope for Congress and the next President.</p>

<p>Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 22, 2018, the United States Congress once again passed a short-term measure to maintain funding for the federal government, this time through February 8, 2018. While it contained a critical extension of funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, it failed to reauthorize and fund several other key expired health care programs and policies, each of which are vital to our health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This lapse in authorization and funding, coupled with the continuous enactment of short-term patches, has put in jeopardy health care services for seniors on Medicare and patients in underserved communities, resources for health care providers in rural communities, and programs aimed at training primary care physicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the programs that have been allowed to lapse or are awaiting reauthorization and funding are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Community Health Center Fund</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Physician Fee Schedule GPCI Parity Policy</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations call on you, as leaders of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, to ensure the inclusion of provisions that will reauthorize and fund these important programs in any government funding legislation approved on or before February 8, 2018.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These programs and policies enjoy strong bipartisan support and many have been approved for reauthorization and funding by the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, during the current Congress. The continued lack of predictable funding for these programs and policies stands to negatively impact the lives of millions of people and communities all across the nation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We urge you to prioritize the continuation of these programs and policies and take the appropriate steps to ensure that each are reauthorized and funded as part of the next government funding bill.</p>

<p>Chairmen Brady and Walden, and Ranking Members Levin and Pallone:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition to Promote Independence in Medicare urges you to include H.R. 4006, the “Community Based Independence for Seniors Act of 2017,” in future legislation that addresses Medicare reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>H.R 4006, sponsored by Reps. Linda Sanchez, Pat Meehan, Leonard Lance and Kurt Schrader, would create a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan (CBI-SNP) Demonstration to help frail, low income Medicare beneficiaries remain in their homes and avoid institutionalization, potentially saving Medicare and Medicaid millions of dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legislation, which gathered 36 co-sponsors in the last Congress, targets Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) to Medicare beneficiaries with incomes at or below 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). To be eligible, beneficiaries must have two or more activities of daily living limitations (e.g., inability to bathe, feed, or dress themselves).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The additional help this legislation would provide would enable these beneficiaries to remain in their homes, where studies show they want to remain. It would help them avoid institutionalization, where they could risk spending down their dwindling assets and becoming dependent on Medicaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doing so, the CBI-SNP demonstration would:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reduce Medicaid long-term care costs;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reduce Medicare acute care costs; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reduce personal long-term care costs for beneficiaries.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CBI-SNP demonstration will make life better for frail seniors and their families. It will also provide policymakers with evidence to support an alternative payment methodology that could re-shape the financing of long term care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We thank you for your efforts and urge you to include the CBI-SNP demonstration provision as you continue to work towards bipartisan Medicare reform.</p>

To see the full list of co-signers and the citations, please see the PDF version&nbsp;<a href=""http://bettermedicarealliance.org/sites/default/files/SNPs%20Coalition%20Letter_Energy%20%26%20Commerce%20Cmttee%20072017%202.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Subcommittee Chairman Burgess, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Green:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We, the undersigned organizations, representing Special Needs Plans, health care providers, advocates and Medicare beneficiaries, write to convey our strong support for Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans (SNPs), and the specialized care they deliver to more than 2.4 million high-need, high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With current SNP authorization expiring at the end of 2018, we remain committed to working this year in a bipartisan manner with Congress and the Administration to permanently authorize all SNPs to ensure that they are stable, accessible, high quality, cost effective, and financially viable for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who depend on SNPs for their care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing that beneficiaries with chronic conditions are among Medicare’s most costly and fastest-growing patient groups, Congress prudently created SNPs in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173). Congress has continued to reauthorize the program since 2003 because the capitated, or fixed dollar amount per member, per month system in Medicare Advantage incentivizes not only the appropriate level of care and better care management for chronic conditions, but also has the capacity to create value-based models of care that provide specialized medical services for these beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, SNPs serving beneficiaries who are dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (D-SNPs), have certain chronic conditions (C-SNPs), or receive long-term care in an institutional setting such as a Skilled Nursing Facility (I-SNPs) have all been highly successful in targeting clinical programs to more effectively care for highrisk beneficiaries who have multiple chronic conditions or complex medical problems. These specialized models of care better coordinate benefits and services for the SNP enrollee population, and include care management tools, such as care managers, interdisciplinary teams, specialized provider networks, and quality improvement plans that can better enable data sharing across health plans and providers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), I-SNPs perform well on quality measures, and have proven success in lowering hospital readmission rates. D-SNPs had the most performance measures with a statistically significant improvement from 2012-2013. A 2012 study found beneficiaries in C-SNPs had lower rates of hospitalizations and readmissions than their peers in FFS Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Congress works to build on these achievements for current and future high-need, high-cost beneficiaries, we firmly believe that several key principles should guide legislative efforts. SNP reauthorization should include provisions that provide for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Stability Through Permanency―Permanently authorizing all SNPs will provide states, health plans, and providers with a stable environment to allow for care continuity for beneficiaries, and for greater planning of and investment in the successful care models that SNPs provide to high-need beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• A Workable Pathway Toward Integration―We agree that integration of Medicare and Medicaid services in D-SNPs is an important goal for states, plans, and beneficiaries. Specific consideration should be given to ensuring states and plans have multiple pathways to work together to tailor integration. In addition, legislation should state explicitly that plans should not be penalized for state decisions that might impede integration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Strengthening the Role of the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office—The MMCO plays a vital leadership role for CMS, states, and plans in advancing dual integration in general. For integration to be successful over time, the MMCO should be given regulatory and guidance authority for aligning the spectrum of Medicare and Medicaid policies and procedures for plans charged with integrating benefits and services for dually eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Benefit Flexibility―We are supportive of policies that allow Medicare Advantage plans―including SNPs―to most efficiently and effectively meet the needs of chronically ill beneficiaries. This includes policies expanding the type of supplemental benefits plans can offer these beneficiaries, as well as expanding the use of Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID), which is currently being tested by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). These policies will allow SNPs to better tailor medical and social services for their high-need enrollees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these principles as you work to further policies that will better enable Medicare Advantage SNPs to provide high quality care over the long term and focus on prevention, coordinated care, better management of chronic conditions, and new provider payment models that reward value over volume and meet the needs of complex patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We appreciate the thoughtful work and stakeholder engagement offered by the committees of jurisdiction. We stand ready to work with you to ensure continuity, affordability, and peace of mind for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who depend on SNPs for their care.</p>

To see the full list of co-signers and the citations, please see the PDF version&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BENES-Act-Support-SignOn-HR2575-0617.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Congressman Ruiz and Congressman Meehan:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations share a commitment to advancing the health and economic security of older adults, people with disabilities, and their families. Together, we represent the 57 million Americans who rely on Medicare for guaranteed access to health benefits. We are writing to express our strong support for the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification (BENES) Act (H.R. 2575).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic rules underpinning the Part B enrollment system were developed more than fifty years ago, when Medicare was first established. The BENES Act offers long-overdue solutions to modernize and simplify Part B enrollment. Through bipartisan, low-cost reforms, the BENES Act shields people with Medicare from steep premium penalties and fills needless gaps in coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While many individuals are automatically enrolled in Medicare because they are receiving Social Security benefits, an increasing share of newly eligible beneficiaries must actively enroll in the benefit. Knowing whether and when to enroll in Part B requires that a person understand when to sign up during time-limited windows, how their current insurance will work with Medicare, and what penalties may result if enrollment is delayed. The consequences of missteps can be significant and often lead to a lifetime of higher Part B premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2014, 750,000 people with Medicare were paying a Part B Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) and the average LEP amounted to nearly a 30% increase in a beneficiary’s monthly premium.1 In addition to this considerable penalty, many retirees and people with disabilities face significant out-of-pocket health care costs, gaps in coverage, and barriers to care continuity resulting solely from honest enrollment mistakes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BENES Act significantly alleviates these challenges. H.R. 2575 fills long-standing gaps in notice and education for those approaching Medicare eligibility and aligns and simplifies Part B enrollment periods. Taken together, these changes will help prevent costly enrollment slipups among the 10,000 people becoming Medicare eligible each day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For people who are not auto-enrolled in Medicare, there is virtually no communication that provides education on when and how to enroll in Medicare or what may result from delayed enrollment. As a result, many of our organizations hear from older adults and people with disabilities who wrongly believed that because they had existing insurance, like COBRA benefits, retiree insurance, or a Marketplace plan, they did not need to enroll in Part B. These individuals often face severe consequences that prevent them from receiving urgently needed health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BENES Act requires that a clear and detailed notice explaining Part B enrollment rules is mailed to all individuals aging into Medicare and those nearing eligibility because they receive Social Security disability benefits, aligning the mailing of this Medicare notice with existing Social Security notices, where possible. Additionally, H.R. 2575 brings Part B enrollment periods in line with those of private insurance products, including Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D prescription drug plans, allowing for more uniform education and outreach. The BENES Act also guarantees that people with Medicare will no longer go without needed outpatient care due to needlessly delayed coverage start dates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Far too many people with Medicare are irreversibly harmed due to an outdated Part B enrollment system. The BENES Act presents an important opportunity for members of Congress to advance commonsense, bipartisan reforms that are in the best interest of the many millions of Americans who will soon come to rely on Medicare. We applaud your leadership on the BENES Act. Thank you.</p>

1031,"Joint letter requesting funding for AHRQ within the FY 2018 spending bill","<!-- wp:heading {""level"":6} -->
<h6><em>This letter was originally organized and sent by AcademyHealth on behalf of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.academyhealth.org/node/294"">Friends of AHRQ</a>&nbsp;to the House and Senate’s Appropriations Committees’ leadership. Please see the PDF versions of the House letter&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.academyhealth.org/files/AHRQ%20Approps%20Request.Omnibus.House_.Final_.pdf"">here</a>&nbsp;and Senate letter&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.academyhealth.org/files/AHRQ%20Approps%20Request.Omnibus.Senate.Final_.pdf"">here</a>.</em></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you and your colleagues prepare to negotiate a final spending bill for fiscal year (FY) 2018, the 150 undersigned organizations respectfully request that you fund the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) at a level equal to or higher than the Senate mark of $324 million. AHRQ is an essential element of the nation’s health care ecosystem, charged with improving the quality and delivery of health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discovering cures is critical to patients, providers, and our communities. However, understanding how to most effectively&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;those cures to patients through health services requires research that is equally critical. AHRQ is the only federal agency whose sole focus is to generate reliable research on how to deliver the highest quality care, at the greatest value, with the best outcomes to all patients. It is the only agency that funds research on the “real-world” patient—the one who doesn’t have diabetes alone, for example, but also has cardiovascular disease and renal disease; or the patient who has cancer, as well as heart disease. AHRQ-funded research allows us to understand where waste, inefficiencies, and gaps exist within the health care system, and allows patients, payers, providers, and others to harness American innovation and make the health care system safer, more efficient, and more effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, AHRQ is helping doctors in rural communities fight the opioid epidemic by developing and testing effective medication assisted therapy protocols that could save thousands of lives, something of particular importance as we fight the current opioid epidemic. AHRQ is also providing primary care clinicians and their patients with tools to make evidence-based decisions about which medications to use for treating alcohol use disorder. AHRQ is the federal agency singularly responsible for reducing the nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States each year associated with medical errors and is supporting researchers who continue to search for ways improve patient safety and outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While $324 million does not restore AHRQ’s budget to its previous funding levels or allow for critical initiatives that were terminated as a result of the cuts to return, it will ensure that the agency can continue its critical mission. Additional cuts to AHRQ will result in the loss of life and cost saving research as was seen in FY 2016, where promising research projects were eliminated. Among those was the agency’s research portfolio to optimize care for America’s nearly 60 million patients living with multiple chronic conditions. By 2020, an estimated eighty-one million people will have multiple chronic conditions and the costs of their care will consume 80 percent of publicly funded health insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This research portfolio – maintained solely by AHRQ – was the only source of such information on how to most successfully and cost efficiently treat these patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health services research shows that as much as one-third of the more than $3 trillion our nation spends on health care each year is waste—care that is inappropriate, ineffective, or harmful. Every dollar we invest in generating evidence to eliminate that waste is a sound fiscal investment. Funding AHRQ will help to ensure that our health care system becomes the most efficient one in the world for both patients and taxpayers. We urge you to make maintaining funding for AHRQ, and its critical research, a priority in the FY 2018 omnibus</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Minority Leader Pelosi:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations share a commitment to advancing the health and economic security of older adults, people with disabilities, and their families. Together, we represent the 57+ million Americans who rely on Medicare. We need your commitment to pass the bipartisan Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification (BENES) Act (S. 1909; HR 2575) by the year’s end. This bi-partisan, bi-cameral legislation is urgently needed to improve Medicare Part B enrollment, and to modernize the now-outdated 1965 law to align with changes in the Social Security and Medicare Advantage laws. The legislation has widespread support from everyone from MA Plans to beneficiary advocacy groups, and needs your support now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic rules underpinning the Part B enrollment system were developed more than 50 years ago, when Medicare was first established. The BENES Act offers long-overdue solutions to modernize and simplify Part B enrollment. Through bipartisan, low-cost reforms, the BENES Act shields people with Medicare from steep premium penalties and fills needless gaps in coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing whether and when to enroll in Part B requires that a person understand when to sign up during timelimited windows, how their other insurance will work with Medicare, and what penalties may result if enrollment is delayed. The consequences of missteps can be significant and include higher out-of-pocket costs, significant gaps in coverage, and lifetime penalties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2014, 750,000 people with Medicare were paying a Part B Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) with the average LEP amounting to nearly a 30% increase in a beneficiary’s monthly premium.1 In addition to this considerable penalty, many retirees and people with disabilities face large out-of-pocket health care costs, gaps in coverage, and barriers to care continuity because of honest enrollment mistakes.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Leader Pelosi:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations write to voice our strong support for the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act (S. 974/H.R. 2212) and encourage Congress to pass this important, bipartisan legislation as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Trump remarked in his State of the Union address that the “injustice of high drug prices [is] one of our top priorities.” It is also a top priority for voters across the country, and Congress has a golden opportunity to make a real impact on prescription drug prices by passing the CREATES Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of our organizations is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to the life-enhancing and life-saving medications that they need at an affordable price. It is undisputed that the key driver of affordability in prescription drugs is competition from generics once the market exclusivity has expired on a brand-name medication. Unfortunately, manufacturers of brand name drugs often go to great lengths to stave off competition from generics in order to keep prices high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In particular, certain companies abuse the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulatory rules that allows them to use a tool designed to protect patient safety as a pretext to deny generic manufacturers the ability to purchase the samples they need to bring more affordable FDA-approved drugs to market. These actions contradict Congressional intent. Through this anticompetitive abuse, brand companies extend their monopoly pricing power, costing patients and the healthcare system an additional&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gphaonline.org/media/cms/REMS_Studyfinal_July2014.pdf"">$5.4 billion</a>&nbsp;annually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CREATES Act is a narrowly targeted, bipartisan, pro-competition, and market-based solution to these abuses that cost patients, job-creators, and taxpayers billions of dollars each year. The CREATES Act is a step towards restoring the balance that Congress attempted to strike in Hatch-Waxman, between providing incentive for innovation through exclusivity while providing for affordability through generic competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We thank the bipartisan, bicameral sponsors of this important legislation for the work that they have done to, in the words of FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, “end the shenanigans” by certain brand companies, and we strongly encourage Congress to pass the CREATES Act without delay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We write on behalf of some of the most vulnerable Medicare seniors, disabled and critically ill patients across America who are now facing serious health care consequences if Congress does not pass a Medicare legislative package soon.

<p>Both the House and the Senate, in a bipartisan way, advanced several bills/provisions through their committees of Medicare jurisdiction in 2017, as many of the impacted programs either expired or otherwise required Congressional action by the end of 2017. Now that we are well into 2018, Congress’ inaction on these important Medicare policies could mean real harm to the vulnerable patients we serve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is only through action by Congressional leadership that these bipartisan, and often bicameral policies, can be finalized. Thank you for your prompt and bipartisan attention to these matters.</p>

<p>Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Leader Pelosi:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations write to voice our strong support for the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act (S. 974/H.R. 2212) and encourage Congress to pass this important, bipartisan legislation as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Trump remarked in his State of the Union address that the “injustice of high drug prices [is] one of our top priorities.” It is also a top priority for voters across the country, and Congress has a golden opportunity to make a real impact on prescription drug prices by passing the CREATES Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of our organizations is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to the life-enhancing and life-saving medications that they need at an affordable price. It is undisputed that the key driver of affordability in prescription drugs is competition from generics once the market exclusivity has expired on a brand-name medication. Unfortunately, manufacturers of brand name drugs often go to great lengths to stave off competition from generics in order to keep prices high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In particular, certain companies abuse the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulatory rules that allows them to use a tool designed to protect patient safety as a pretext to deny generic manufacturers the ability to purchase the samples they need to bring more affordable FDA-approved drugs to market. These actions contradict Congressional intent. Through this anticompetitive abuse, brand companies extend their monopoly pricing power, costing patients and the healthcare system an additional&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gphaonline.org/media/cms/REMS_Studyfinal_July2014.pdf"">$5.4 billion</a>&nbsp;annually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CREATES Act is a narrowly targeted, bipartisan, pro-competition, and market-based solution to these abuses that cost patients, job-creators, and taxpayers billions of dollars each year. The CREATES Act is a step towards restoring the balance that Congress attempted to strike in Hatch-Waxman, between providing incentive for innovation through exclusivity while providing for affordability through generic competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We thank the bipartisan, bicameral sponsors of this important legislation for the work that they have done to, in the words of FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, “end the shenanigans” by certain brand companies, and we strongly encourage Congress to pass the CREATES Act without delay.</p>

<p>Dear Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Lowey, Chairman Cole, and Ranking Member DeLauro:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the largest purchaser of health care—more than $1 trillion per year and rising—the federal government has an enormous stake in spending each health dollar wisely. Patients deserve health care that works for them, and taxpayers deserve smart spending. That means care delivered at the right time, in the right setting, by the right professional. It means that patients receive cutting-edge care, whether that patient lives in South Carolina, South Dakota, or south Jersey – and it means no patient is harmed by the care they receive due to a preventable medical error. It’s a tall order and a tough job, but the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) helps achieve such success day in and day out. AHRQ doesn’t attract great attention to itself; it’s a workhorse. But AHRQ saves money, and AHRQ saves lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you draft the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2018, the 151 undersigned members of the Friends of AHRQ respectfully request $364 million in budget authority, which is consistent with the FY 2015 level and would signal your continued commitment not just to produce discoveries, but to produce science that translates medical progress into better care for patients today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AHRQ funds the research needed to change what’s wrong and share what’s right in day-to-day health care delivery. Universities and other research institutes throughout the nation conduct this critical research. AHRQ also generates data to monitor the health care landscape and ensures the pipeline of new medical findings reaches health care providers and patients, regardless of where they work and live, and provides them with the tools and training they need to use those findings every day in the care of patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example of AHRQ’s successful work includes research grants to ensure rural primary care practices are equipped to respond to the opioid crisis. An explosion in the incidence of opioid addiction and overdoses, particularly in rural areas of the country, has elevated this issue to crisis-level in the United States. Primary care practices are often the first line of defense against this and other substance use disorders. In addition, AHRQ is the federal agency singularly responsible for reducing the nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States each year associated with medical errors. AHRQ’s innovative Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections—first applied on a large scale in 2003 across more than 100 ICUs across Michigan—saved more than 1,500 lives and nearly $200 million in the program’s first 18 months. This project has since been expanded to hospitals in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vast majority of federally funded research focuses on one specific disease, organ system, cellular or chemical process. AHRQ is the only federal agency that funds research on the “real-life” patient—the one who doesn’t have diabetes alone, for example, but also has cardiovascular disease and renal disease; or the patient who has cancer, as well as heart disease. In 2000, an estimated 60 million Americans had such multiple chronic conditions. By 2020, an estimated 81 million people will have multiple chronic conditions and the costs of their care will consume 80 percent of publicly funded health insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Unfortunately, the $30 million cut AHRQ sustained in FY 2016 resulted in the termination of the agency’s portfolio aimed at optimizing care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Restoring AHRQ’s budget to the FY 2015 level of $364 million will support research to supply providers with the tools they need to best serve these patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Friends of AHRQ recognize the importance of investing federal funds strategically. We strongly believe that AHRQ more than earns a place among your appropriations priorities, and urge you to restore the agency’s funding to at least $364 million in FY 2018.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Mr. President and Mr. Vice-President:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the nation’s leading clinicians, employers, hospitals, biopharmaceutical companies, pharmacists, patients, consumer groups and insurance providers, we are writing to underscore our commitment to advancing the highest quality, most cost-effective healthcare system in the world. We call upon Congress and the Trump Administration to help us achieve this goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Healthcare has been operating in a fee-for-service system designed more than 50 years ago. Over the years, the regulations governing this system have grown extraordinarily complex. This complexity hampers efforts of clinicians and other healthcare providers who have been diligently working to measurably improve quality, reduce costs and take accountability for populations of patients. Despite these impediments, organizations have made significant investments in building and testing alternative payment models that are designed to move healthcare forward to promote value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This work has been spurred by nearly two decades of bipartisan leadership and was most recently accelerated by this Congress’ overwhelming passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA). Through private and public sector alignment, the move toward value-based care is succeeding, measurably improving healthcare quality and contributing to historically low costs. Now is not the time for policymakers to signal a shift away from value based care, either through action or inaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We, the undersigned, strongly support this movement and are committed to working with Congress and the Trump Administration to build the next generation of healthcare policy. As you take up the mantle of addressing the challenge of improving quality while safely reducing costs, we strongly urge you to continue focusing on driving value-based, patient-centered payment models that incent healthcare innovation. Together, we share a vision for a modernized, sustainable healthcare system based on the following principles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Empower and engage patients to make healthcare decisions with information and support from their healthcare team.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Invest in engaging patients in the development of measures of provider performance that are relevant to them and consistently and transparently reported by all public and private payers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improve clinician and provider access to timely, accurate and complete claims data to better facilitate care management.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Recognize that the socioeconomic status of many patients creates challenges in providing care, and adjust payments to providers as appropriate.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Design voluntary payment models that incent greater participation and achieve the highest quality and cost value based on patient choice and competitive markets.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand the use of waivers from fee-for-service legal and regulatory requirements that impede collaboration and shared accountability, while preserving consumer protections and safeguards against fraud.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Build on and expand payment models that promote collaborative financial and care coordination arrangements using incentives that align payers, healthcare providers, providers of long-term care services and clinicians.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Appropriately incent access to medical innovations and treatments that hold the potential to improve quality of care and reduce overall system cost.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Promote public and private investment in the transparent, evidence-based testing and scaling of new alternative payment models as directed in MACRA so that clinicians, other healthcare providers and payers can learn how payment models work and evolve in the clinical setting.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure alignment between private and public sector programs, which is critical to a sustainable value-based payment marketplace.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stand prepared to work vigorously with the Administration and the Congress to expand upon the quality and cost savings progress made in America, and we look forward to taking the next steps to reach and surpass the tipping point where value-based healthcare becomes a sustainable marketplace for generations of Americans to come.</p>

1039,"Joint letter urging CMS to extend time-limited equitable relief for Marketplace enrollees who missed Medicare enrollment","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This letter was originally organized and sent by the Medicare Rights Center to Administrator Seema Verma.&nbsp;To see the full list of co-signers and the citations, please see the PDF version&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CMS-SignOn-Letter-Marketplace-ER-Extension-092017.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations share a commitment to advancing the health and economic security of individuals and families with Marketplace coverage and with Medicare. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a time-limited equitable relief opportunity for select individuals currently or previously enrolled in Marketplace plans who delayed Medicare enrollment. This important relief is set to expire on September 30, 2017, and we are writing to urge CMS to issue an extension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the establishment of this relief, CMS is responding appropriately to the needs of Marketplace enrollees who became newly eligible for Medicare as the Marketplaces were still in their infancy. Time-limited equitable relief allows Marketplace enrollees who are or were unfamiliar with Marketplace and Medicare rules concerning coverage and financial assistance to enroll in Medicare Part B without a Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP). This lessens a significant hardship for many people who inadvertently delay or decline Part B enrollment because they are unaware of the repercussions that could result from keeping their Marketplace coverage. Because of beneficiary delays in learning of and applying for this important relief, we request that CMS extend the policy. We recommend that the agency retain the policy through the end of 2017 or longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to qualify for time-limited equitable relief, an individual must be enrolled in premium-free Part A and have an Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) that began April 1, 2013 or later, or have been notified of retroactive premium-free Part A on October 1, 2013, or later. To request time-limited equitable relief, the individual must contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) or visit a local Social Security office and ask to use timelimited equitable relief to enroll in Part B and/or eliminate the Part B LEP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opportunity to apply for time-limited equitable relief improves the financial health and well-being of people new to Medicare. We believe an extension of this critical relief is warranted for several reasons. First and foremost, some of our organizations have observed that case delays at SSA are hindering some attempts to apply for time-limited equitable relief. An extension of the policy could result in better awareness of time-limited equitable relief within SSA and would give the agency more time to process applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, at least two populations were notified about the availability of time-limited equitable relief only very recently. CMS’ Periodic Data Matching (PDM) notices for the disability population were mailed several months later than those for the non-disability population (aged 65+), likely leading to delays among people with disabilities in seeking time-limited equitable relief. Further, the PDM notices are only available to those dually&nbsp;enrolled in Medicare and the federally-facilitated Marketplace. Select State-based Marketplaces opted to follow CMS’ lead and notify their enrollees about time-limited equitable relief, but did so only in recent months. Additionally, Marketplace enrollees who are Medicare-eligible but not enrolled have yet to receive any direct notification about time-limited equitable relief from the federal government, as the agency’s PDM notices are targeted to those dually enrolled in Medicare and the Marketplaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, in the 2018 Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters, CMS finalized an interpretation of guaranteed renewability and Medicare anti-duplication such that an issuer who has knowledge that an enrollee in individual market coverage is entitled to Part A or enrolled in Part B is prohibited from renewing the individual market coverage if it would duplicate Medicare benefits unless the renewal can be effectuated under the same policy or contract. Thus, beginning in 2018 open enrollment, issuers must non-renew enrollees if the issuer has positive knowledge that the enrollee is dually enrolled and the renewal is not under the same policy or contract. As a result more consumers will need to transition from the Marketplace to Part B coverage in 2018, and extending the time-limited equitable relief will greatly ease that transition for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, lack of data makes it difficult to determine how many eligible consumers may have already applied or are in the process of applying for time-limited equitable relief. Without this valuable data, caution urges that more time be given to allow affected individuals to apply. For these reasons, it will continue to be important that people can apply for time-limited equitable relief past September to ensure timely enrollment in Medicare free of financially burdensome penalties. Again, we thank CMS for establishing this needed relief and for considering our request to extend its availability.</p>

1040,"Joint Letter Urging the President to Preserve Funding for Public Health and Prevention","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Please find the PDF version, with co-signers listed,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Joint-Letter-to-POTUS-re-Public-Health-and-Prevention-Fund.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear President Trump:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the more than 500 undersigned organizations, we are writing to warn of the dire consequences of repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund (the Prevention Fund), authorized under the Affordable Care Act. Repealing the Prevention Fund without a corresponding increase in the allocation for the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill would leave a funding gap for essential public health programs, and could also foretell deep cuts for other critical programs funded in the bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, more than 12 percent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) budget is supplied through Prevention Fund investments. This includes core public health programs that provide essential funds to help states keep communities healthy and safe, such as the 317 immunization program, epidemiology and laboratory capacity grants, the entire Preventive Health and Health Services (Prevent) Block Grant program, cancer screenings, chronic disease prevention and other critically important programs. For example, the Prevent Block Grant provides all 50 states, the District of Columbia, two American Indian tribes, and eight U.S. territories with flexible funding to address their unique public health issues at the state and community level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the growing and geographically disparate burden of largely preventable diseases, health threats such as the opioid epidemic, and emerging infectious disease outbreaks such as the Zika virus, federal disease prevention and public health programs remain critically underfunded. Public health spending is still below pre-recession levels, having remained relatively flat for years. The CDC’s budget authority has actually decreased by 11.4 percent since FY 2010 adjusted for inflation, and the Prevention Fund has helped to make up the difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discretionary programs, including public health, education, and job training programs funded through the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education (LHHS) appropriations spending bill have been cut dramatically and disproportionately in recent years as lawmakers have worked to reduce the deficit, even though experts across the political spectrum agree these programs are not a driving factor behind our nation’s mid- and long term fiscal challenges. Eliminating the Prevention Fund would be disastrous to the CDC budget and programs, and to the LHHS bill as a whole, leaving a nearly $1 billion budget hole which would be impossible to fill under current discretionary spending caps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funding prevention not only saves lives but it saves money. A comprehensive study of evidence-based prevention programs found that every dollar invested yields $5.60 in savings. There are many provisions of the Affordable Care Act aimed at promoting health and prevention, but the Prevention Fund is particularly important – a dedicated investment in prevention and public health activities to counteract the much larger bill – $3.2 trillion and growing – we pay every year as a country to treat illness and disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We urge you to maintain funding made possible by the Prevention and Public Health Fund and safeguard funding for the CDC and other programs under the Labor-HHS-Education spending bill.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At NCHC, we want to do our part to help educate people about Alzheimer’s disease and the need to address what is not only a public health crisis, but a source of high health care costs for payers and families.&nbsp; Below are some key facts about the disease:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Alzheimer’s is a leading cause of death</u></strong>:&nbsp; One in six seniors will die from Alzheimer’s or another dementia, and it is the 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;leading cause of death in the U.S.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Alzheimer’s is a disease that affects the whole family</u></strong>:&nbsp; Alzheimer’s patients are cared for by 15 million caregivers in the U.S. and 100 million worldwide.&nbsp; In 2015, 15.9 million family and friends provided 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care to those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Alzheimer’s is a heavier burden for women and minorities</u></strong>:&nbsp; Women make up two-third of those with Alzheimer’s and approximately two-thirds of caregivers are women, and 34 percent are age 65 or older African Americans are twice as likely and Latinos 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s than white Americans, although the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><u>Alzheimer’s is an expensive disease:</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In 2016, total payments for health care, long-term care and hospice are estimated to be $236 billion for people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, with&nbsp;just under half of the costs borne by Medicare. Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias. In 2050, it will be one in every three dollars.&nbsp; It can have a devastating impact on families, too.&nbsp; On average, caregivers lose over $15,000 in annual income as a result of reducing or quitting work to meet the demands of caregiving.</p>

1042,"Justifying After the Fact Is Not Justification","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A recent study funded by the National Institute on Aging compared Gilead’s Sovaldi to previous Hepatitis C treatments on a cost-benefit basis and concluded that Sovaldi offered value. This study is a perfect example of getting the answer only to the question you ask.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is true that Sovaldi is more efficacious than previous therapies. However, that is far from the full picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>What the study should have asked is whether or not the price Gilead set for the therapy is appropriate for all patients–even asymptomatic patients–and whether or not such a large portion of potential societal value should accrue to one company. Other studies, such as one conducted by the highly-respected California Technology Assessment Forum, concluded that Sovaldi does not offer reasonable value to the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the study highlights a bigger problem: the fact that these studies are only offered after a drug is priced and have no bearing on the pricing decision. Gilead’s President, Dr. John Milligan, has made it quite clear that Gilead doesn’t price based on value, but instead by looking at the price of preceding products. What we need is a system where there is a more rigorous up-front economic and social evaluation of expensive new therapies. Without that evaluation, we end up with what we have in Sovaldi and Harvoni–monopolistic pricing where there is an attempt to justify legitimacy after the fact.</p>

<p><strong>Key Measures to Curb Health Costs Included in Budget Deal</strong><br><em>Statement by John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, on House and Senate Passage of H.R. 8, The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sandwiched between the hotly debated tax provisions and an urgently needed fix to Medicare’s physician pay, negotiators have tucked three underappreciated, but important, steps toward lower health care costs in today’s budget bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Second, the act provides badly needed funding for the development of quality metrics for medical care. These measurement efforts are crucial to private and public initiatives to reform health care delivery and lower costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the law establishes bonuses for medical providers who participate in clinical registries. These state-of-the art analytic tools, usually linked to electronic medical records, help physicians and other providers track and improve the quality of the care they provide. The medical specialties which have pioneered their use, cardiology and thoracic surgery, have produced dramatic improvements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These provisions are only small steps on the road toward an affordable health system, but they are important. The National Coalition on Health Care believes we can do even more to curb costs by improving care delivery and cutting waste.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proportion of children in the USA with coverage through their parents' benefit plans at work has declined from 65% in the mid-80s to 53% in 1995, which translates to about 700,000 children a year losing employer-based health insurance. If the trend continues, a projected 12.6 million children will be uninsured by 2000. (Employee Benefits Research Institute)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the 10 million uninsured children (a quarter of the nation's 40 million people without coverage): 34% are teen-agers; 500,000 are younger than 1; 86% live in families with at least one working parent; 65% live in families with annual incomes of $25,000 or less; and 63% live in two-parent families; 37% live with one parent.

<p>By&nbsp;Kate Ackley<br>Roll Call Staff<br>June 26, 2012, Midnight</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On K Street, waiting for the Supreme Court’s health care ruling goes something like this: schedule post-decision client conference calls, write multiple drafts of talking points for different outcomes, and hole up in a conference room trying to figure out whether constitutional law-speak can translate into English.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every interest with a stake in the health care overhaul — which covers basically every lobbyist in town — has been waiting and speculating on whether the statute survives a constitutional challenge. And they are waiting some more with the decision not due until Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The work is and has been: sitting in windowless rooms with lawyers and legal analysts trying to do scenario planning and decision trees,” explained the Raben Group’s Robert Raben, a former House Judiciary Committee counsel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry McNeely, manager of policy communications and advocacy for the National Coalition on Health Care, said his office — from senior staff to the summer interns — has been waiting “with bated breath, glued to the SCOTUS blog.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve written a number of variations on three different press releases” depending on which way the court goes, he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A spokesman for one of the most closely watched parties, America’s Health Insurance Plans, declined to comment on internal strategy, meetings or whether it’s set up a SCOTUS war room. But spokesman Robert Zirkelbach did say the health care plan lobby plans to trumpet how a requirement in the law that would make insurers cover everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, is inextricably linked with other insurance reforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, there’s only so much that lobbyists can do in advance. And some K Streeters caution that as crazy as this week promises to be post-ruling, the real lobbying will spin well into next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even so, the health care decision will play big on the campaign trail, meaning stakeholders will have to hit the road with their messaging, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tax People Cometh to the Hill</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While everyone waits for the health care decision, a collection of tax executives is planning a day of lobbying Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tax vice presidents from such companies as Altria, Macy’s and Raytheon&nbsp; will spend the day meeting with senior Treasury officials as well as Senate Finance Chairman&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/members/287.html"">Max Baucus</a>&nbsp;(D-Mont.) and House Ways and Means Chairman&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/members/243.html"">Dave Camp</a>&nbsp;(R-Mich.), among others, according to organizers of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are hoping that meetings early in the tax reform process will help them shape the debate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Coalition’s tax VPs are ideally suited to describe, in fine-grained detail, just how America’s ‘dubiously world-leading’ 35 percent corporate tax rate and incredibly complex corporate tax code are hurting job creation and economic growth,” said James Pinkerton, who co-chairs the Reforming America’s Taxes Equitably coalition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Setting Up Shop</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a new firm in town — and in New York, Beijing and Brussels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lane Bailey, the former president of public affairs at Golin|Harris, is opening the Advocom Group along with A.J. Donelson, who was head of 3M’s Washington lobby outpost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bailey in an interview said his new business would focus on a lot more than lobbying. “Washington is still hugely important; lobbyists are hugely important,” he added. “But there’s a bigger dynamic going on. It involves corporate leadership and capital markets, how you’re perceived by consumers and investors,” said Bailey, a former chief of staff for Sen.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/members/538.html"">Jay Rockefeller</a>&nbsp;(D-W.Va.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Government affairs, corporate leadership and capital markets are all part of the advocacy world now, Bailey said. “Advocacy, public policy, is global, and you’ve got to think of it like that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advocom’s domestic hires include Christa Carey Dunn, Randi Kahn, Jeff Kimball, Ken Levinson, Holly Page and Carolyn Tieger with international hires John Russell and Robert Magyar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group will announce its clients in the next few weeks, Bailey said, declining to name them now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And DelPizzo Makes Nine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex DelPizzo, most recently a partner with Winning Strategies, is moving his lobbying practice to Thorn Run Partners. He is the 2-year-old shop’s ninth lobbyist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before decamping for K Street, DelPizzo was legislative director for then-Rep. Mike Ferguson (R-N.J.), focusing on health care, energy, telecom and transportation. He also worked for former Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster (R-Pa.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DelPizzo and Thorn Run already shared clients including Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Lundbeck. “I’ve seen this firm as it has grown, and I have always been impressed with their level of service,” DelPizzo said of his decision to join the shop. “For me, personally, this gives me a great bipartisan platform.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is bringing with him several clients including Advanced Drainage Systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The most enjoyable part about running a firm is being able to surround yourself with people you want to go to work with everyday,” firm co-founder Andy Rosenberg said. “He’s super smart and super diligent.”</p>

<h6><em>Statement by National Coalition on Health Care President and CEO John Rother on the passage of a Continuing Resolution to reopen government and reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program&nbsp;</em></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“While NCHC is relieved by the six-year CHIP reauthorization and the reopening of most federal offices, the ongoing failure to extend other vital health programs is a breakdown in leadership across both parties. This inaction will&nbsp;harm patient outcomes and increase costs across the health system.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The new Continuing Resolution left out vital funding for our nation’s primary care infrastructure and workforce programs, such as Community Health Centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers. It also left out important bipartisan reforms to Medicare addressing&nbsp;<a href=""https://meehan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-benes-act-clarifies-streamlines-medicare-enrollment"">enrollment procedures</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://energycommerce.house.gov/news/press-release/bipartisan-framework-reached-repeal-medicare-therapy-caps/"">outpatient therapy caps</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/senate-unanimously-passes-chronic-care-act"">chronic care</a>. And because certain provisions of existing Medicare law expired on December 31st, rural hospitals, physicians, and nurse practitioners are already seeing Medicare reimbursement cuts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Each of these excluded provisions enjoys broad bipartisan, bicameral support. Community Health Center and workforce funding has actually passed the House as part of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. The Ways and Means Committee has already announced a bipartisan agreement on the expiring Medicare provisions – also known as “extenders.”&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/870/text"">The CHRONIC Care Act</a>&nbsp;passed the Senate unanimously and many of its provisions have cleared House Committees.

<p>“NCHC is ready and willing to work together on innovative solutions to our health care affordability challenges. But if we are ever going to successfully address America’s rising costs of care, Congress and the administration must stop playing politics with our nation’s health.”</p>

1048,"LA Times: Drug executives come to Washington as Republicans grapple with how to stop runaway prices","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a much-anticipated piece of political theater, seven leading pharmaceutical executives appeared before a powerful Senate committee Tuesday for a grilling from lawmakers who pledged a historic bipartisan effort to rein in skyrocketing prescription drug prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even as drug prices have emerged as one of the few areas of common concern for President Trump and congressional Democrats, the drugmakers made no firm commitments to lower prices, and lawmakers — particularly Republicans — are far from settling on a strategy to force or even encourage companies to lower their prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And although the Trump administration has taken a number of modest administrative steps to change the way that prescription drugs are purchased through Medicare, prospects are dimmer for a compromise with Democrats, who are seeking much more aggressive government intervention to rein in prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, any compromise presents a double-edged sword politically, offering lawmakers something to campaign on in 2020, but also potentially handing the opposing party a victory as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Republicans, who have historically resisted government restrictions on drug companies, should have a lot of incentive to prove that they can reduce healthcare costs, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who presided over Tuesday’s hearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Republicans have to start looking at it this way: We’re on a slippery slope to single [payer] unless we start recognizing the fact that one of the reasons we lost the midterm elections was because … 41% of the people in the elections thought healthcare was most important and 75% of them voted Democrat,” he said,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">referring to exit polls</a>&nbsp;from the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voters in 2018&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-analysis-20181108-story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">punished the GOP for the party’s efforts</a>&nbsp;to repeal the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, and some Republicans hope that a successful effort to tackle prescription drug prices would win some of them back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grassley, who for years was a lonely GOP voice calling for aggressive steps to take on drugmakers, now has allies on his side of the aisle as well as the gavel of the Senate Finance Committee, which in recent years was headed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a closer ally of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Democrats, for their part, feel like they need to deliver on their own midterm election pledge to reduce drug costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is no question that Democrats in the Senate and the House have made an enormous investment in getting this issue to where it is — on the radar, and pounding at home day in and day out, in community meetings,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The convergence between the parties has given hope to consumer advocates and those in the healthcare industry that a legislative breakthrough is within reach, despite the poisonous political environment in Washington. An increasing number of states, including California,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-drug-companies-pay-for-delay-generic-phama-20190220-story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">are also stepping up efforts</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One proposal to make it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to prevent the development of generic alternatives to their drugs has attracted bipartisan support from senators, including some liberal Democrats such as Vermont’s Patrick J. Leahy and conservative Republicans such as Ted Cruz of Texas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think there is enough of a recognition about the problem … that something has to be done,” said Matt Eyles, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry’s Washington-based lobbying arm. “It is clear that members of Congress on both sides are increasingly alarmed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuesday’s hearing gave senators, particularly Democrats, plenty of opportunity to vent frustration with&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-drug-prices-20181206-story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">price hikes</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as expected, drug executives largely dodged responsibility for high prices, blaming insurers while emphasizing their commitment to developing life-saving therapies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the drugmakers also signaled support for several initiatives being discussed in Washington, including proposals to target pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, the historically opaque companies that have negotiated drug prices on behalf of insurance companies. The executives also praised efforts to promote development of generics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some Democrats have been buoyed by the fact that Trump has gone further than other Republicans on drug policy, even&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-drug-prices-20180511-story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">suggesting vaguely</a>&nbsp;that the federal government should be able to negotiate drug prices in Medicare (though the administration has not formally proposed this).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s broken some new ground that no Republicans have been willing to break,” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.). “I don’t know that we’d be well-served by being against it simply because most of the rest of his healthcare policy is mean-spirited.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there is still considerable skepticism in Washington that congressional Republicans will back legislation that challenges the drug industry’s pricing practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“Senate Republicans are now saying the right things, voicing outrage over drug pricing,” said John Rother, a former longtime executive with the AARP who now heads the reform advocacy group National Coalition on Health Care. “The real test will be whether they will support legislation that will actually lower prices and protect patients from price gouging.”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several GOP lawmakers are already attacking Democrats’ calls for more aggressive action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The other side wants [direct drug] negotiations for [the Department of Health and Human Services]. They want price controls,” said Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas). “Those are things that are nonstarters. And they’re not going to happen. To the extent that they’re willing to move off their ideological high ground, and we’ve moved off some of our ideological high ground, I think there is perhaps some room.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, lawmakers who would write the legislation are tight-lipped on what a plan would look like. Grassley framed Tuesday’s hearing as one of several he expects to hold before a bill is released. In a recent meeting with reporters, he said he doesn’t know what exactly his legislation would say, but outlined the goal as “taking secrecy out of the whole process.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Grassley and Wyden suggested they want to know more about whether PBMs are keeping rebates offered by drugmakers from consumers, a concern that&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/06/2019-01026/fraud-and-abuse-removal-of-safe-harbor-protection-for-rebates-involving-prescription-pharmaceuticals"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">has also been highlighted by the Trump administration</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you have difficulty having people explain it to you or they don’t want to explain it to you, … there’s something wrong and we’re trying to right that wrong,” Grassley said of drugmakers and others in the prescription drug distribution process.</p>

<p>With a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the National Coalition on Health Care sponsored a briefing series for businesses that would engage business leaders in a dialogue about the critical role that corporate America has in determining the health of the nation. These highly informative and thought-provoking sessions sought to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Encourage America's foremost business leaders to extend their vision beyond the immediate cost issues surrounding the provision of health care benefits to include a broader understanding of the meaningful role that business has in determining the nation's future health care environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Provide detailed briefings and analysis on national trends relative to cost, quality and access that will demonstrate how these three interrelated issues are impacting businesses and the nation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Illustrate the long-term societal costs that result from short-term cost-saving measures taken by both the private and public sectors.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition believes that corporate America plays a key role in the health care system, by providing health care coverage to most workers and their families. The intent was to challenge America's most innovative, resourceful business minds to apply their collective wisdom to understanding and addressing the problems facing America's health care system.<strong>1999 Executive Business Series</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading executives around of the country attended Executive Briefings on Health Care which were conducted by the Coalition in conferences held in San Diego, Washington, and Houston, which completed the Coalition's Executive Briefing Series. These conferences were designed to enhance business leaders' understanding of the potential for their involvement in the health care system, as well as the limitations on their individual actions to resolve the major health care problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In San Diego, the Coalition's meeting was co-sponsored by Scripps, Qualcomm, and SAIC (Scientific Applications International Corporation), three large businesses in the San Diego area. The meeting held in Houston was co-sponsored by the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's major business group. In Washington, the Coalition's meeting was co-sponsored by a Coalition member, the Communications Workers of America. Leaders of all the major communication firms in the country convened in Washington for a dialogue on health care issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meetings were facilitated by Dr. Michael Maccoby, president of the Maccoby Group. Presentations were made by Dr. Henry Simmons, the Coalition's president, Kenneth Thorpe then director of Tulane University's Institute for Health Services Research, (now at Emory University), and Mark Goldberg, Distinguished Faculty Fellow at the Yale School of Management.</p>

1052,"Letter in support of HR 3692, the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This letter was originally sent to the House of Representatives on March 20, 2018 by NCHC.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Representative Tonko, Representative Lujan, Representative Stefanik, and Representative McKinley:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write to express the National Coalition on Health Care’s (NCHC) support for HR 3692, the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC&nbsp;is&nbsp;a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing more than 80 participating organizations, including medical societies, businesses, unions, health care providers, faith-based associations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, minorities,&nbsp;and persons with disabilities.&nbsp;The Coalition is committed to advancing - through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy – an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and other Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) are exacting an enormous toll in lives and in increased economic burden. The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 64,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses alone in 2016. &nbsp;According to the Altarum Institute, the combined economic costs of substance abuse since 2001 have exceeded $1 trillion, inclusive of health spending as well as lost wages and productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet as of today, the specialty behavioral health infrastructure and workforce is not large enough to successfully address this challenge. Prevention, screening, assessment, and treatment for substance use disorders, and other behavioral health conditions, must be fully integrated with the rest of health care – particularly primary care. To effectively combat this epidemic, the United States must mobilize the full range of health care professionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HR 3692 would make meaningful progress towards this goal. It makes permanent the broad buprenorphine prescribing authority for Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants that was enacted as part of the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act of 2016. This legislation further expands that authority to Certified Nurse Midwives, Clinical Nurse Specialists, and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists and eases restrictions on the number of patients that can be treated by qualified practitioners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a time when opioid use and substance use disorders seriously threaten the nation’s health, we must bring all qualified health professionals fully into this fight. Please do not hesitate to contact NCHC’s Policy Director Larry McNeely at&nbsp;lmcneely@nchc.org&nbsp;if you have questions regarding this letter or related issues.</p>

1055,"Lifting Barriers to Telehealth","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology has transformed our day-to-day interactions and allowed for efficient communication across long distances. We participate in virtual meetings with coworkers, instantly share photos with family through social media, and Skype friends overseas. Telehealth technologies promise to similarly revolutionize how we experience health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telehealth includes an increasing variety of applications and services that use two-way video, email, smart phones, wireless tools, and other forms of communication technology. Demand for telehealth has been growing, as it offers many potential benefits including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Broader access to providers: Telehealth services have been used for over 40 years to provide healthcare services to patients in faraway locations. Given the provider shortages now prevalent in both urban and rural areas, telehealth has a unique potential to allow patients to access healthcare professionals from a distance.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increased cost efficiency: Telehealth has the potential to lower healthcare costs and increase efficiency through better management of chronic disease and reduced length or frequency of hospital stays.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enhanced quality of care: In some cases—particularly in mental health care and ICU crises—more timely access to specialists through telehealth services&nbsp; can be crucial to positive health outcomes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telehealth has the potential to break distance barriers to reshape the way care is delivered and coordinated. And this year, on Capitol Hill, bipartisan legislative initiatives are afoot to ensure that telehealth realizes that potential—through both the efforts of the Senate Finance Committee’s Chronic Care Working Group and the introduction of impressive stand-alone telehealth legislation, the CONNECT for Health Act, in the House and Senate last month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This legislative focus on telehealth is sorely needed.&nbsp; Despite significant technological developments, actual use of telehealth technologies has been limited—particularly among the Medicare population. Although telehealth options are becoming more common within commercial health plans, federal payment rules have largely prevented widespread use of the same services for Medicare beneficiaries. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) restricts when telehealth services can be reimbursed; typically, the patient must be in another health clinic or physician’s office (an approved “originating site”), live in a rural area, and communicate via live, two-way video.&nbsp; And only a small, defined set of 22 services—those that “mimic normal face-to-face interactions between patients and their health care providers”<a href=""https://nchc.org/lifting-barriers-to-telehealth/#_edn1"">[i]</a>—are covered, including office visits, consultations, pharmacological management, and individual and group self-management training services.<a href=""https://nchc.org/lifting-barriers-to-telehealth/#_edn2"">[ii]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, fewer than 1% of Medicare beneficiaries receive any care remotely.&nbsp; Medicare spent just $14 million on telehealth services out of $614 billion total expenditures in 2014.<a href=""https://nchc.org/lifting-barriers-to-telehealth/#_edn3"">[iii]</a>&nbsp;Despite growing evidence suggesting that remote monitoring technologies improve patient outcomes, Medicare restricts approved technologies to real-time video and voice communications. Restrictions based on this limited conception of telemedicine obstruct the use of modern, potentially cost-saving services by patients who could certainly benefit from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other payers have made more progress towards offering broader coverage and better reimbursement for telehealth services. For instance, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the world’s largest telehealth program, and has made several changes to expand access to telehealth. The VHA does not have a rural geographic requirement for coverage, and recently implemented a policy to eliminate copays for most telehealth services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coverage of telehealth services has also significantly increased among private insurers in recent years. While CMS introduced reimbursement for telehealth as a way to improve access to care for patients living in rural areas, private payers today are eagerly utilizing a broad range of telehealth services as a means of achieving savings while improving health outcomes. The nation’s largest insurer, United HealthCare, announced that it would cover telehealth consultations for most of its 26 million commercial members by the end of 2016. Another major insurer, Anthem, expects to cover virtual urgent care visits for 20 million members by the end of this year. Medicare significantly lags behind other payers in adopting telehealth technologies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this may soon change. In recent years, Congress has shown an interest in facilitating greater use of telehealth.&nbsp; During the 113<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Congress alone, more than 50 bills related to telehealth were introduced.<a href=""https://nchc.org/lifting-barriers-to-telehealth/#_edn4"">[iv]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, Congress has focused on identifying meaningful and achievable legislative steps. In December 2015, the Senate Committee on Finance released a Bipartisan Chronic Care Working Group Policy Options Document.&nbsp; And just last month the CONNECT (Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies) for Health Act of 2015 was introduced with bipartisan sponsorship in the House and Senate. Together, these legislative efforts reflect an emerging powerful consensus around the next steps on telehealth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Changing Medicare Advantage Regulations</em>:&nbsp; Currently, Medicare Advantage plans must categorize most telehealth services as a supplemental benefit and are not allowed to include them as a part of their bid. Both the CCWG Policy Options Document and the CONNECT for Health bill propose including telehealth services as part of basic benefits in Medicare Advantage. Allowing plans to include telehealth in their bids may help them fund the utilization of telehealth services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Loosening Geographic Restrictions:</em>&nbsp;The CCWG Policy Options Document contains proposals that focus on lifting geographic restrictions on telehealth reimbursement for ACOs. The CONNECT for Health Act would provide similar flexibility for all alternative payment models approved under MACRA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Adding Originating Sites</em>:&nbsp; Both legislative efforts expand the list of approved originating sites for Medicare. The CONNECT Act would add telestroke facilities for evaluation and management, Native American health services facilities, and facilities for home dialysis in certain cases to the list of originating sites. Similarly, the CCWG Policy Options Document focuses on changing originating site restrictions to provide more flexibility for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease and receiving home dialysis. The Working Group considers two possible changes: first, lifting geographic requirements for reimbursement so that dialysis facilities in non-rural areas would be considered acceptable originating sites, and, second, including dialysis patients’ homes as considered acceptable originating sites as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the proposals above, CONNECT establishes a “bridge” program that aims to help providers transition to the Merit-based Incentive Payment System and alternative payment models by allowing them to use telehealth and remote patient monitoring without many existing restrictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether these proposals advance as part of the CCWG effort, or through other legislation, they demonstrate that policymakers understand that updated telehealth policies are necessary for a better, more efficient healthcare system. Telehealth has great potential to improve access to quality health care and decrease costs, and make healthcare encounters more convenient and satisfying for both patients and providers. This recent push to lift Medicare restrictions on telehealth reimbursement reflects consumers’ growing demand for convenience and innovation and providers’ efforts to deliver cost-effective care with high-quality results.</p>

<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 would reduce funding for Medicare and Medicaid by about $434 billion over the next seven years. These spending reductions would be achieved through expanded enrollment in managed care, increased premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, reduced coverage, and reduced payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers. However, some portion of the reductions in provider payments under these programs is likely to be passed on to privately-insured persons in the form of higher charges through cost shifting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this study we estimate the potential effects of this cost shifting on private insurance premiums and costs for employers and families. We also estimated the number of persons who would lose coverage under the bill due to reductions in eligibility under the Medicaid program or increases in private plan premiums. In addition, we estimate the increase in charity care expenses due to increases in the uninsured population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We begin by summarizing the Medicare and Medicaid spending reductions and reviewing the evidence on cost shifting. We also estimate the cost shift under these budget cuts and the impact that this would have on employers and families. In addition, we estimate the change in insurance coverage likely to result from this increase in insurance premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Medicare Spending Reductions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Reconciliation Act would reduce Medicare program funding by $270 billion over the next seven years. The act establishes the ""MedicarePlus"" program which would permit Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in a broader variety of private health plans. The act would also increase beneficiary Part-B premium payments and would improve fraud detection and coordination of benefits for persons with employer-based coverage. The plan also specifies specific cuts in provider payments and creates a ""fail-safe"" mechanism which would further reduce provider payments if budget spending targets under the bill are exceeded in future years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Medicare would save $57.3 billion due to the Part-B premium increase and another $9.1 billion through fraud detection and coordination of benefits provisions. Another $26.7 billion would be saved through increased enrollment in private plans. The reductions in provider payments for services (including ""fail-safe"" amounts) would be $105.3 billion for hospitals, $27.0 billion for long-term care and $44.5 billion for physicians and other providers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Medicaid Spending Reductions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The act reduces federal Medicaid funding by about $163.4 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. The bill converts the Medicaid program to a block grant program to states. The amount of each states grant would be based upon spending levels prior to implementing these reforms and would be indexed based upon an overall budget ceiling calibrated to produce $163.4 billion in federal budget savings over the 1996 through 2002 period. States must match the federal contribution based on state matching rates under the current program in order to receive the maximum federal grant</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We assume that states will put into the program only what is required to obtain the maximum federal match under the federal grant program. This implies an additional reduction in state Medicaid spending of $123.3 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. We assume that states will reduce provider payment rates so that per-capita growth in costs under the program is reduced from its current growth rate of 7.0 percent to 5.0 percent. If further funding reductions are necessary, they would take the form of reduced eligibility under the program. Under these assumptions, Medicaid enrollment is reduced by 8.5 million persons by 2002.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Evidence on Cost Shifting</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost shifting is the process whereby providers recover uncompensated care costs and payment shortfalls for public program enrollees through higher charges to private payers. For example, hospital payment rates under public programs are on average about 10 percent below costs. Hospitals also incur about $12.3 billion in uncompensated care expenses for uninsured and underinsured persons.<sup><a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#one"">1</a></sup>&nbsp;<a>These</a>&nbsp;shortfalls are recovered at least in part by increasing charges to private payers as much as 30 percent above actual costs for persons covered under private plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some studies suggest that hospitals shift as much as half of these payment shortfalls to private payers while others show less evidence of cost shifting. Our own analyses indicate that in recent years about 40 percent of the increase in hospital payment shortfalls in each year is passed on to consumers in the form of higher mark-ups on care provided to privately-insured persons. In addition, a recent study of physician pricing by Thomas Rice,&nbsp;<em>et al</em>. indicates that each one percent reduction in public payer rates is associated with a 0.2 percent increase in physician charges to private payers.<sup><a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#two"">2</a></sup>&nbsp;<a>It</a>&nbsp;is clear from these studies, however, that providers are able to shift only a portion of payment shortfalls to private payers in part because selective contracting by health plans has made it more difficult for providers to shift costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based upon a review of the literature, we assumed that 40 percent of the increase in hospital payment shortfalls under these budget cuts would be passed on to private payers in the form of higher charges. However, we assume that the percent of payment shortfalls that are shifted declines in future years to reflect continued growth in selective contracting. We also estimated cost shifting for physician payment shortfalls based upon the Rice analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the assumptions used in this analysis, payments to providers would be reduced by about $218.9 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. Uncompensated care expenses for those who become uninsured would also increase by about $65.5 billion over this period. The total increase in provider payment shortfalls would be about $284.4 billion. We estimate that in response to this, providers would shift about $84.7 billion (29.7 percent) of the $284.4 billion in payment shortfalls to private payers&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure1"">(Figure ES-1)</a>. About 52.7 percent of the increase in cost shifting would be attributed to the Medicare cuts while 47.3 percent would be attributed to Medicaid cuts.<a><strong>FIGURE ES- 1</strong></a><strong><br>ESTIMATED COST SHIFT UNDER MEDICARE<br>AND MEDICAID BUDGET CUTS</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cost Shift by Payer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The increase in provider charges to private payers resulting from the cost shift ($84.7 billion) would be reflected in higher private insurance premiums. Employer health spending would increase by $69.3 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period, while employee contributions for employer health coverage would increase by $5.9 billion. Expenditures for individually purchased non-group insurance would increase by $10.2 billion over this period due to the cost shift. As a result of this cost shift, by 2002, private insurance costs would be about $21.4 billion (four percent) higher than under current trends&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure2"">(Figure ES- 2)</a>.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 2</a><br>CHANGE IN PRIVATE INSURANCE COSTS RESULTING FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BUDGET CUTS UNDER THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Impact on Workers and Families</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Empirical evidence indicates that employers are likely to pass on much of the increase in employer costs to employees in the form of reduced wages. Based upon a review of the literature, we estimate that about $61.0 billion of the $69.3 billion increase in employer costs due to cost shifting would be passed on to workers in the form of lost wage growth. This wage loss is in addition to the $5.9 billion increase in employee premium contributions resulting from higher private insurance premiums. Overall, the amount of the cost shift passed through to workers would be $66.9 billion including lost wage growth ($61.0 billion) and higher employee premium contributions ($5.9 billion). Lost wages and increased premium contributions -- commonly called the pass-through -- would equal about $925 per covered worker over the 1996 through 2002 period&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure3"">(Figure ES- 3)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cost shift would affect costs for both public and private employee health benefits plans. About 18 percent of the cost shift pass-through to workers would fall on government employees (i.e., state, local and federal government employees) while about 82 percent would fall on covered workers in private health plans&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure3"">(Figure ES- 3)</a>. The amount of the pass-through per worker would tend to be highest among industries with the most comprehensive health plans such as manufacturing and transportation.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 3</a><br>DISTRIBUTION OF COST SHIFT PASS-THROUGH TO COVERED WORKERS BY INDUSTRY (1996 THROUGH 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pass-through of the cost shift will have a disproportionate impact on insured workers in lower wage groups. The lost wage increases resulting from these budget cuts would on average equal about 2.5 percent of the wage increase that workers would have received in the absence of these budget cuts over the 1996 through 2002 period&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure4"">(Figure ES- 4)</a>. However, the wage growth lost due to cost shifting would vary from about 9.3 percent for covered workers earning $6.00 or less per hour to only 1.6 percent for persons earning $25 or more per hour. This reflects the fact that health benefits represent a much greater share of total compensation expenses for lower-wage covered workers than for higher-wage covered workers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cost shifting resulting from the proposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts would be distributed across families in all income brackets. Much of the increase in family expenditures would be concentrated among middle and upper income households where private insurance coverage is most prevalent. About 60 percent of the pass-through would fall on families with annual incomes between $20,000 and $75,000. About 10 percent would fall on families with incomes below $20,000 while 30 percent would fall on families with incomes in excess of $75,000 per year.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 4</a><br>PERCENT OF WAGE INCREASE FOR COVERED WORKERS OFFSET BY COST SHIFT FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID CUTS: 1996 THROUGH 2002&nbsp;<sup>a/</sup></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We estimate that the number of uninsured persons in the U.S. under current policy will increase from 39.7 million persons in 1995 to 45.9 million persons by 2002. At the same time, Medicaid coverage is expected to increase from 36.8 million persons in 1995 to 45.9 million in 2002. With the reductions in funding under the reconciliation act, it is unlikely that states will be able to fund this increase in enrollment. In addition, private insurance costs will increase due to increased cost shifting under the act. Thus, the number of uninsured is likely to increase under the act due to reductions in Medicaid eligibility and higher private insurance costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the reconciliation act, the number of uninsured in 2002 would increase from 45.9 million to 53.7 million&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/lewinstudy/#figure5"">(Figure ES- 5)</a>. This is an increase in the number of uninsured persons of 7.8 million persons in that year. This includes: about 7.2 million persons who lose Medicaid coverage under the bill who have no other coverage; and about 647,000 persons who lose employer coverage due to premium increases resulting from the cost shift.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 5</a><br>NUMBER OF UNINSURED WITH AND WITHOUT THE RECONCILIATION BILL (IN MILLIONS)</strong><img src=""https://nchc.org/images/figurees-5.gif"" alt=""Line Graph - Figure 5"" width=""409"" height=""216""></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Summary and Caveats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ultimately, families will pay for the cost shift. Private insurers pass the burden of higher prices on to their customers in the form of higher premiums. Employers then pass on much of these increased premium costs to workers in the form of reduced wage growth and increased employee contributions. We estimate that the proposed Medicare and Medicaid budget cuts are expected to increase real health expenditures for workers by $66.9 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. The cost shift could be substantially different than we have estimated here depending upon the effectiveness of managed care and the way in which providers respond to the budget cuts.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This analysis is limited to the financial effects on employers and employees by industry, firm size and income. It does not describe the effects of increased public- program shortfalls on the availability and quality of care for program beneficiaries and the uninsured. It also does not describe the impact of cost shifting on health care providers beyond the loss of revenues. Moreover, this study examined only the impact of those provisions of recent budgetary legislation affecting Medicare and Medicaid. The study does not examine the impact of various other budgetary changes affecting families such as tax reductions or cutbacks in public assistance benefits.</p>

<h1>MACRA Quality Metrics: Looking Beyond the Walls of the Clinic</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JUNE 24, 2016&nbsp;BY&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/author/nisha/"">NISHA BHAT</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Monday is the deadline for public comments on a proposed rule implementing key provisions of MACRA (Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015).&nbsp; Released in April, this draft regulation explains how physicians should measure and report the quality of care they provide and how they will be compensated under Medicare. It is the first real step implementing last year’s historic, bipartisan physician payment reform legislation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With MACRA, legislators of both parties sought, not just repeal of the Sustainable Growth Rate’s system of automatic payment cuts to physicians, but a fundamental change in the way that physicians are compensated.&nbsp; And true to that aim, the proposed rule stresses paying clinicians for their performance on an array of measures that promote improved patient outcomes and higher-value care.&nbsp; It would also establish strong incentives for physicians to move towards alternative payment models (APMs) that better integrate health care delivery.&nbsp; The details of these proposals are important and NCHC will be offering its comments next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, MACRA’s impact on health care outcomes and costs may ultimately depend upon the answer to a question that is barely addressed in the 962 pages of the proposed rule: how will quality measures assess the extent to which physicians and other clinicians can reach beyond the four walls of the clinic to address a range of non-clinical factors that influence health outcomes and costs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Admittedly, current federal law presents barriers to broader use of non-clinical interventions.&nbsp; Medicare generally does not reimburse providers or most plans for non-medical in-home support or nutrition services - even when they might prevent future downstream medical costs.&nbsp; If providers or plans do furnish these services to enrollees, they can risk running afoul of anti-kickback regulations. Congressional action is required to fully address these barriers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet even under current legal authority, CMS could do more to encourage physicians to connect patients who would most benefit from supportive and preventative services to appropriate community resources. CMS’ final rule on MACRA, due November 1, should start moving us in that direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quality metrics that encourage physicians to utilize targeted upstream community-based interventions could result in both cost savings and reduced prevalence of disease. For example, the recently launched Prevent Diabetes STAT program is working to increase the number of physicians who screen patients for prediabetes and refer them to community diabetes prevention programs.<a href=""https://nchc.org/macra-quality-metrics-looking-beyond-the-walls-of-the-clinic/#_edn1"">[i]</a>&nbsp;One analysis estimates prediabetes screenings and lifestyle change interventions have the potential to save $539 billion in medical costs over a 10 year period.<a href=""https://nchc.org/macra-quality-metrics-looking-beyond-the-walls-of-the-clinic/#_edn2"">[ii]</a>&nbsp;The dramatic potential for savings underscores the need to make such screening for and referrals to the programs like this a priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Effective clinical and community collaboration could also address important social determinants of health. Analyses of “super-utilizers” of emergency departments show a high prevalence of multimorbidity, substance use and mental health disorders, as well as social barriers to care such as homelessness.<a href=""https://nchc.org/macra-quality-metrics-looking-beyond-the-walls-of-the-clinic/#_edn3"">[iii]</a>&nbsp;Partnerships with community-based social services are vital to meeting the medical and non-medical needs of these high-risk patients and avoiding substantial downstream costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, quality measures that incentivize collaboration and connection with these community resources are few and far between in CMS’ draft regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To their credit, CMS has begun to think through these possibilities.&nbsp; The proposed rule seeks comments on the possible inclusion of a “social and community involvement” category in the “clinical practice improvement activities” (CPIA) component of MIPS.&nbsp; Under this option, clinicians could get some credit for completed referrals to and partnerships with community and social services.&nbsp; It is a good idea as far as it goes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But because a clinicians’ performance on CPIA comprises only 15% of their total performance score under the law, this particular proposal would provide only weak incentives for providers to harness community resources. Moving forward using their existing statutory authority, regulators should ensure that the quality component of MIPS, accounting for 50% of physicians’ score, also include robust, valid measures that broaden clinicians’ sphere of concern beyond the four walls of their office or clinic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be sure, the MACRA proposed rule is an important step to a payment system based upon value not volume. But to effectively move towards the goal of integrated, high-quality health care, physician incentives must promote effective and targeted upstream interventions and community partnerships. As MACRA’s Quality Payment Program evolves, metrics which encourage these activities must be included and appropriately weighted.</p>

1062,"Making Prescription Drugs More Affordable","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>oday’s drug pricing trends, particularly in the specialty drug sector, seriously threaten the affordability of health care in the United States. For years, patients and purchasers have shouldered prices of more than $100,000 a year for certain medicines – particularly those that treat relatively rare disorders.&nbsp;But in a concerning new development, the industry is increasingly applying rare-disease pricing to treatments for diseases afflicting millions: hepatitis, cancer, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. If this trend is left unchecked, American health care will soon face an untenable choice: reduce access to medications needed to manage common chronic conditions or face increasingly unaffordable cost burdens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why NCHC and our 501 c4 affiliate the NCHC Action Fund have launched the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing.&nbsp; a non partisan coalition of organizations informing the debate on drug pricing and finding bipartisan, market-based solutions to lower drug prices in the U.S. Members represent hospitals, physicians, nurses, consumers, health plans, pharmacists, and employers.</p>

1063,"Now is the Time to Lower Prescription Drug Prices","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were two big stories from the pharmaceutical industry this week, both reported by the Wall Street Journal: 1) Bristol-Myers Squibb intends to acquire Celgene in a $74 billion dollar deal; and 2) drug manufacturers have already hiked prices for hundreds of medicines for 2019. Both stories suggest that tough talk from President Trump isn’t working to restrain drug prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is neither self-restraint nor discipline of “the market” in the pharmaceutical industry. Bipartisan oversight and legislative reforms are needed to rebalance incentives and rewards to protect taxpayers and patients while retaining incentives for real innovation. Fortunately, new leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives is pledging to take such action. The new Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, also has a track record of vigorous oversight. Chairman Grassley led the fight to require that pharmaceutical makers report gifts to physicians (i.e. “the Sunshine Act”), which was included in the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pharmaceutical giants resist efforts to link their prices to independent reviews of their outcomes and relative effectiveness. They also resist honest accounting and transparency of the cost of drug development and the public subsidies that support it. Notably, Bristol-Myers Squibb is offering Celgene stockholders a special contingent payment if Celgene’s pipeline drugs win FDA approval. In other words, a performance-based reward is offered to shareholders, but not to patients and taxpayers. The costs of escalating drug prices are felt at the pharmacy counter as patient cost-sharing rises, felt by employers and workers in higher premiums, and by all of us as the strain on Medicare and other public budgets crowds out other priorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the National Coalition on Health Care, we intend to work with the new Congress to bring some sanity and sunshine to the pricing practices of Big Pharma. Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries must get a better deal for drugs, and reforms must be made to end patent abuse that prevents competition from lower cost generic drugs. We must have sustainable policies that reward the discovery of true “break through” therapies but don’t require families to set up Go Fund Me pages, or result in insurance premium spikes that put coverage out of reach for more and more Americans.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is a key factor driving this growing problem:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The consumption of sweetened beverages has increased dramatically in the past thirty years.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In 2009, Americans consumed 13.8 billion gallons of sugar-sweetened beverages.<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>That’s 70,000 empty calories per person.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several health consequences of obesity:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, etc.</li>

<li>Type II diabetes mellitus is increasing in youth.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, several states have implemented a sales tax on soda sold at restaurants and vending machines; however, there are no statistically significant differences in obesity prevalence between states without taxes on soda compared to states with taxes with at least a 5% sales tax on soda. Studies have found that an excise tax would be most effective in decreasing consumption versus a sales tax since an excise tax applies to the wholesaler or producer of the SSB and this is directly passed on to the consumer and reflected in the shelf price. Additionally, studies have found that a substantial taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages can reduce consumption:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A study&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/1/199.abstract"">found</a>&nbsp;that a nationwide penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would reduce consumption by 15% among adults.&nbsp; This would prevent:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Implement a penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce consumption and its associated problems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Policymakers should earmark the revenue generated from the tax for obesity prevention programs in order to further reduce associated health problems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some legislators and political organizations do not support an excise tax on Sugar Sweetened Beverages because they believe that the tax is regressive and places a burden on working families. However, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is regressive—greater burden on the poor than the rich—with lower income and minority groups consuming more sugary beverages. The tax would actually reduce this disparity by decreasing consumption in these groups and therefore decreasing the health problems associated with consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, many food companies argue against the tax since they believe it is unethical and the public will not support it. However, roughly one-third to one-half of consumers supports SSB taxes and over two-thirds of the population supports SSB taxes if the revenues will be used for obesity prevention and health promotion.&nbsp; In all, the benefits of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages outweigh the negatives and the tax should be implemented for the benefit of public health.</p>

<p>Some legislators and political organizations do not support an excise tax on Sugar Sweetened Beverages because they believe that the tax is regressive and places a burden on working families. However, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is regressive—greater burden on the poor than the rich—with lower income and minority groups consuming more sugary beverages. The tax would actually reduce this disparity by decreasing consumption in these groups and therefore decreasing the health problems associated with consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Medicare beneﬁciaries are being denied access to Medicare’s skilled nursing facility (SNF) beneﬁt because of the way hospital stays are classiﬁed.<br></strong>Under Medicare law, patients must have an inpatient stay in a short-term acute care hospital spanning at least three days (not counting the day of discharge) in order for Medicare to pay for a subsequent stay in a SNF. However, under current Medicare rules, acute care hospitals are increasingly holding patients under “observation,” an outpatient designation, rather than admitting them as inpatients. Outpatients may stay for many days and nights in hospital beds and receive medical and nursing care, diagnostic tests, treatments, medications, and food, identical to that of inpatients. As a result, although the care received by patients in observation status is the same medically necessary care received by inpatients, outpatients who need follow-up care do not qualify for Medicare coverage in a SNF. Hospital stays classiﬁed as observation, regardless of their length and the type or number of services provided, are considered outpatient. These outpatient hospital stays, even if they span several days, do not qualify patients for Medicare-covered care in a SNF; only inpatient time counts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hospitals’ use of observation status and the amount of time patients spend in observation status are both increasing.<br></strong>An early study* found a 34% increase in the ratio of observation stays to inpatient admissions between 2007 and 2009, leading the researchers to conclude that outpatient observation status was increasingly becoming a substitute for inpatient status. The same study also documented increases in long-stay outpatient status, including an 88% increase in observation stays exceeding 72 hours. A 2013 report by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that in 2012, beneﬁciaries had 617,702 hospital stays that lasted at least three days, but that did not include three inpatient days. The pattern continued. In December 2016, the Inspector General reported that 748,337 long hospital stays were called outpatient, including 633,148 outpatient stays of three or more days, in FY 2014. Between FYs 2013 and 2014, outpatient stays increased by 8.1%, despite implementation of the two-midnight rule (see reverse side of document) that was expected to decrease outpatient stays.</p>

<p><strong>Support for counting time spent in observation status toward the three-day prior inpatient stay continues to grow:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Inspector General’s 2013 report was supportive of counting observation days towards the three-day inpatient stay requirement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In September 2013, the Congressionally-created Long Term Care Commission recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) count time spent in observation status toward meeting the three-day stay requirement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In 2015, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) explored various policy options for counting time spent in observation toward meeting the SNF 3-day requirement. The Commission unanimously recommended that CMS revise the SNF 3-day rule to allow for up to two outpatient observation days to count toward meeting the requirement, recognizing that beneﬁciaries are needlessly facing barriers to accessing needed post-acute care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2017 counts the time Medicare beneﬁciaries spend in observation toward the three-day stay requirement, so that Medicare patients who spend three days in a hospital, regardless of inpatient/observation designation, are able to access post-acute care in a SNF when they need it.<br></strong>Legislation re-introduced this Congress with bipartisan support would create a full and permanent solution.&nbsp;<strong>The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2017 (S. 568/H.R. 1421)</strong>, sponsored by Representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-PA) and Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) would help Medicare beneﬁciaries who are hospitalized in observation by requiring that time spent in observation be counted towards meeting the three-day prior inpatient stay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recent efforts to address the problem of observation status have fallen far short of a comprehensive ﬁx.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The NOTICE Act, while a step in the right direction, does not go far enough to ensure patients have access to needed post-acute care services.<br></strong>Enacted into law in August 2015, the NOTICE Act requires hospitals to inform patients who are receiving outpatient observation services for more than 24 hours that they are outpatients, not inpatients. Hospitals and critical access hospitals had to begin using the Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice (MOON) no later than March 8, 2017. While receiving written and oral notice informs patients of their status, the law – although a positive step forward – does not give patients hearing rights or count the time in the hospital for purposes of SNF coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The OIG recently found that a new rule intended to slow the growth in long outpatient stays – the so-called “two-midnight rule” – does not eliminate, and in fact has exacerbated, the barriers beneﬁciaries face in accessing needed post-acute care services.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>How the 2-Midnight Rule Works<br></em>In October 2013, CMS adopted the “two-midnight rule”, which establishes time-based criteria for physicians to use when deciding to admit a patient as an inpatient or keep them under outpatient observation. The rule states that for patients expected to require hospital services for at least two midnights, inpatient admission will be presumed appropriate for payment. Likewise, for patients expected not to require hospital services for at least two midnights, outpatient observation is presumed appropriate. The rule was intended to give admitting physicians additional assurance that their decision to admit would not be questioned by auditors, thereby reducing the incidence of long outpatient stays. CMS intended the two-midnight rule to decrease the number of long outpatient stays and decrease the number of short inpatient admissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What the OIG Found<br></em>In a December 2016 report2, the OIG found that since the implementation of the two-midnight rule, total outpatient stays have increased and total inpatient stays have decreased – the opposite of CMS’ expectations – exacerbating an already challenging problem. It is now clear that while CMS intended to ﬁx the problem through implementation of the two-midnight rule, it has inadvertently worsened the situation for thousands of beneﬁciaries who are unable to access needed post-acute care. The report recommends that CMS analyze the potential impacts of counting time spent in as an outpatient toward meeting the SNF three-day requirement so that beneﬁciaries receiving similar hospital care have similar access to post-acute care services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the rule and its revision reﬂect CMS’ concerns about long outpatient stays, hospitals are unlikely to change their practices when CMS provides no meaningful guidance on when an inpatient stay of fewer than two midnights is appropriate. Physician decisions about patient status continue to be reviewed by hospitals under the same standards as before: short inpatient decisions are prioritized for review by Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs); and the specter of audits by Recovery Auditors (still known as RACs) remains. The mission of the RACs is to identify and correct Medicare and Medicaid improper payments. A RAC’s determination that a patient has been incorrectly classiﬁed as an inpatient requires the hospital to return most of the Medicare reimbursement for the patient’s stay, despite the fact that the services were medically necessary and coverable by Medicare. Recently-imposed penalties for readmitting a hospital patient within 30 days increase hospitals’ motivation to classify patients as outpatients, rather than inpatients.</p>

1067,"Op-Ed: The Necessity Of Exploiting Pricing Power in a Post-Consolidated Health Care World","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Originally posted on Morning Consult. You can read the original op-ed&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://morningconsult.com/opinions/necessity-exploiting-pricing-power-post-consolidated-health-care-world/""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Americans are forced to spend over $1 trillion annually on health care services that do not improve their health. What causes this is not the amount of health care services we consume.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compared to similar countries, the United States falls well below average in utilizing hospital and physician services. What drives health care spending are health care prices. For example, U.S. drug prices are two to six times higher than what the rest of the world spends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In early December, the Trump administration issued a lengthy report attempting to address the price or affordability problem. Its solution can be learned by simply reading the report’s title, “Reforming America’s Healthcare System Through Choice and Competition.” The administration recognizes the health care industry, like numerous others, is today highly consolidated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Per the Federal Trade Commission, approximately 75 and 90 percent of insurance companies and hospitals, respectively, in urban markets are defined as highly concentrated. Introducing competition or market forces, the administration believes, will erode industry price gouging. Sadly, the report constitutes motivated reasoning since its argument is more ideological than reality-based.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To drive competition, one would expect administration officials to argue for vigorous antitrust enforcement. They do not. Instead, the report simply states the administration will “continue monitoring market competition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is unsurprising since the Republican party has opposed antitrust enforcement at least since Robert Bork wrote “The Antitrust Paradox” 40 years ago. This view was recently displayed last year when the Republican-led Congress attempted to pass two laws that would have significantly curtailed the FTC’s ability to challenge corporate mergers and disallowed plaintiffs to bring class-action lawsuits with antitrust claims.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The report could have also expressed a desire to take executive regulatory action to curb a pricing power. The administration has instead taken the view that government regulations impede competition. &nbsp;They are burdensome, per se. In December, the administration doubled down by announcing the creation of a special office of health care regulatory reform to further reduce regulatory burden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The administration’s indifference to antitrust enforcement and executive rulemaking should not go unappreciated. Failure to enforce the former causes the latter. When rulemaking inhibits market efficiency, it is termed “regulatory capture” because dominate players in consolidated markets are able to exert undo regulatory influence to their advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This report also argues that patients can drive competition by behaving as typical, discriminating consumers. It is unrealistic to define health care services as a normal market commodity such that the health care industry is forced to compete for patients shopping for value. Economist Kenneth Arrow long ago argued compellingly, and the subsequent evidence supports, the complexity and/or uncertainty in medical diagnoses, treatments and quality leave patients, particularly those lying on a gurney, unable to determine to what extent price reflects value. This is why the evidence shows that neither the availability of one’s medical record nor price transparency tools is associated with lower spending or with lower prices for shoppable tests or visits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question remains: What can be done to address health care affordability in a post-consolidated health care market.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What happens when a consolidated market in an industry where a patient is unable to shop for value is obvious. This is why no country in the world relies on markets to constrain health care prices. What countries do instead is exploit their buying or monopsony power to contain price growth. &nbsp;Fortunately, this is happening with increasing frequency among states where opportunities to drive more affordable health can be defined largely as versions of price controls.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maryland’s hospital all-payer rate-setting system that the state has employed since the 1970s also now &nbsp;aligns annual hospital spending with the state’s overall economic growth rate and a per capita spending growth rate that is below national Medicare per capita average. Since 2012, Massachusetts has used an annual state health care cost growth target albeit with mixed success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past November, the state agreed to allow Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Lahey Health System to merge on the condition the new system accept a seven-year price cap and commit to eight years of funding for low-income and underserved communities. The agreement will avoid an estimated $1 billion in state spending over seven years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oregon’s coordinated care organizations have also been able to hold state Medicaid spending below a targeted 3.4 percent annual growth rate. Arkansas and Tennessee have used bundled payments moreover for surgical procedures to reduce Medicaid spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In North Carolina, state officials are looking to replicate Montana’s success in pegging its health plan hospital rates to Medicare reimbursement. Over the past three years, Montana has saved its state employee plan approximately 7 percent in annual spending.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other states, for example in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey and Washington, officials are working to establish Medicaid buy-in programs that will both save participants out-of-pocket spending and have price control spillover effects in their commercial insurance markets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The value in the administration’s report is in its de facto admission that the federal government will not aggressively enforce antitrust legislation, much less unwind consummated mergers, or similarly exercise executive regulatory authority. Absent these efforts and patients’ ability to discern or shop for value, if we want affordable health care, we have to price health care affordably.</p>

1068,"Op-Ed: With a New Congress, a Window Opens to Finally Bring Down Drug Prices","<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new Congress mostly in place, now split between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, a new dynamic is in place. Any legislation, including efforts to rein in drug prices, will need to have bipartisan support to move forward. Bringing pricing restraint to the costliest prescription drugs&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be a bipartisan priority, especially given President Trump’s public pledges to act on drug prices and the negative impact of costly drugs on the federal budget, not to mention on the budgets of families and employers. The change in the House should provide a new political dynamic that offers possibilities for real action on drug prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump campaigned on a promise to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/31/trump-meets-with-pharma-industry/"">lower “astronomical” drug prices</a>, and called for giving Medicare more negotiating power. He&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/03/what-ceos-say-happened-in-trumps-closed-door-meeting-with-big-pharma/?utm_term=.9d5a74f0f799"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">summoned CEOs</a>&nbsp;from the big pharmaceutical firms to the Oval Office shortly after he was sworn in, brought in the TV cameras, and promised to do something about drug prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today is a perfect time to take stock of what the Trump administration and the previous Congress have done to lower drug prices. As we tally up those actions, we are dismayed by how little progress has actually been made to lower the inflated prices Americans pay for many brand-name drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The president appointed highly qualified professionals to lead important agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and HHS, but the initiatives they have announced, although constructive, won’t directly restrain high drug prices for most people. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/25/trump-speech-drug-prices/"">latest proposal</a>, which is limited to Medicare Part B, would benefit relatively few Medicare beneficiaries and would take five years to implement fully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Americans want big bites taken out of the ever-bigger price tags for the expensive prescription drugs they take most often, which are eating bigger shares of their family budgets, paychecks, and retirement savings. The current Congress has done almost nothing to tackle the problem. Its inaction might have something to do with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/23/phrma-on-track-to-spend-a-record-sum-on-lobbying-this-year/"">record lobbying expenditures</a>&nbsp;and campaign contributions given by big pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the rhetoric on price restraint has been tough, the action to date has not. In fact, it’s been just the opposite. Let’s start with the biggest win and windfall granted to the drug industry: the corporate tax cuts enacted last year, which have been estimated to deliver&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/Pharma-Tax-Cut-Report-4.26.18-FINAL-.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">more than $6 billion</a>&nbsp;to five of the top pharmaceutical companies in 2018. Not only was the corporate tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent, but the tax on profits held outside of the U.S. and repatriated back to the U.S. was also cut — a boon for big multinational drug companies. Drug manufacturers could have used this money to moderate prices, invest in more research and development, raise wages, or even create more U.S. jobs. But they have not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug industry scored another big win in the freshly inked NAFTA replacement, known as the&nbsp;<a href=""https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/united-states-mexico"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a>. The treaty would extend monopoly protections for certain drugs and force both Canada and Mexico to follow suit. So the proposed treaty will actually&nbsp;<em>increase</em>drug costs for all three countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Trump administration has also&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180911/NEWS/180919970"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">delayed a rule</a>&nbsp;that would put a ceiling on prices for drugs sold to so-called safety-net hospitals and clinics, putting another win in the drug companies’ column. In addition, the president’s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-blueprint-lower-drug-prices/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">drug pricing “blueprint,”</a>&nbsp;released in May, hints that it may take action to limit drug discounts for public and nonprofit hospitals and clinics, raising costs for taxpayers and the cost of insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not content with these gifts, drug lobbyists are demanding that congressional leaders lower drug manufacturers’ discounts for seniors who fall in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/10/pharma-drug-costs-burden-donut-hole/"">Medicare “donut hole.”</a>&nbsp;Beware of post-Halloween mischief: Congress comes back to Washington after the midterm elections to pass spending bills without hearings or bill language the public can see. Retiring or defeated members of Congress, perhaps looking for their next jobs, may decide to include this goodie for the drug industry at the expense of Medicare and its beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When tallied next to the big wins or potential wins for the drug industry, the recent proposal to experiment with Medicare Part B drug prices, although welcome, is only a start. Modest proposals to require inclusion of list prices in drug TV advertisements and to give Medicare plans a few tools to boost their negotiating leverage would likely not threaten the status quo of high prices — now coupled with low taxes and more favorable trade terms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/06/democrats-took-the-house-heres-what-that-means-for-health/"">High health care costs</a>, led by high drug prices, were a top issue for voters as they headed to the polls for the midterm election. Getting lower drug prices, however, will take congressional leaders willing to stand up to the drug lobby and a president determined to deliver on his campaign promise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next Congress has the opportunity to take meaningful action to make real the rhetorical promises of more affordable medications. They simply can’t afford to fail.</p>

1070,"Our ailing health care","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rising costs throughout the U.S. health system are a form of internal bleeding likely to doom any economic recovery or deficit reduction plan that does not address the problem directly and systemically.Any efforts to bring our nation to fiscal or economic health will be futile if the hemorrhaging of health care costs remains unchecked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even in spin-saturated Washington, some facts are undeniable. Total expenditures on health care represented 17 percent of the gross national product in 2010 and are projected to reach 20 percent by the end of this decade. The federal government already spends more for health care than for defense, Social Security or any other single spending category. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has emphatically identified rising health costs as the greatest threat to our fiscal future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. Our current system is devastatingly inefficient. The United States spends 141 percent more on health care than other economically advanced nations. But our far higher bill is not buying us a healthier population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roughly 30 percent to 40 percent of medical and hospital costs can be attributed to waste and inefficiency. That means, America is on a path to squander $10 trillion over the next decade. That hemorrhage would leave our economy — and our cities, states, small businesses and middle-class families — on life support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given our financial condition, preventing this kind of spending and the economic drag it represents should be the kind of urgent national problem that overrides ideological differences and encourages us to find common purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recognition of this reality is growing. Cost containment provisions in last year’s Affordable Care Act are an important step in the right direction. In recent months, President Barack Obama and House Republicans have each offered prescriptions to reduce federal health care spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are wildly different approaches — but have one major flaw in common. Neither does enough to address the unsustainable growth in health costs across the entire economy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key to any reform is tackling the whole problem, not just one piece — like health care spending by the federal government, for example, or even the public sector as a whole. Unless spending on health care is curbed systemwide, federal reforms run the risk of just shifting skyrocketing costs to those least able to handle this added burden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare reform can begin the kind of systemic change needed to improve quality, value and efficiency. But without additional action, everyone — from private employers, to struggling cities and counties, to middle-class families, as well as the elderly and disabled — is likely to face a backbreaking burden of higher costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America desperately needs a new strategy — one that takes on rising costs across the public and private sectors and is driven by verified data and evidence about why and how our national spending is growing. This can only be possible if we make every part of our hybrid public and private system more transparent and accountable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need a serious national effort to collect accurate data about cost drivers and price trends, medical decision making and quality of care. This data, collected across all 50 states, could guide policy, give consumers understandable ways to compare health care outcomes and options and create a foundation for a more fair, responsible and sustainable health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A broad coalition that includes business, labor, health care providers and health industry leaders has united behind a commitment to reform our health system. We believe that, without addressing costs, the U.S. won’t be able to resolve concerns about access and quality of care. Indeed, access to quality care inevitably will suffer without a long-term resolution of the cost question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If our diverse coalition can find consensus on the urgent need for systemwide health cost containment and on specific policy principles needed to achieve it, surely our elected leaders can overcome their differences to support solutions that improve health outcomes and the economy’s prospects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The need for action to curb ever-increasing health spending, while increasing value, should be the one area of policy on which it is easiest to reach bipartisan agreement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In coming weeks, elected officials are expected to debate a variety of ideas to get America’s economic house in order. Any policy prescription that does not deal seriously and systemically with rising health costs while improving health outcomes would be a self-defeating exercise in ideological grandstanding — not the relief our country badly needs.</p>

<p>The Trustees project that Medicare will grow from 3.6% of GDP today to 5.6% of GDP by 2040. The program’s financial challenges are magnified for beneficiaries once you consider the affordability gaps in Medicare’s existing benefits—including a lack of a cap on catastrophic out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be clear, there are some positive indications. This year’s growth in Medicare spending per person remains slower than historical patterns and cost growth in the private sector. But even at current per capita growth rates, shouldering the cost of caring for an aging population is going to require sustained bipartisan attention from policymakers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Legislation, now under development by the Senate Finance Committee Chronic Care Working Group, could help address the challenge of caring for chronically ill patients, who account for most Medicare spending.

1108,"Medicaid Per Capita Caps Jeopardize State Reforms Aimed at Medicare Enrollees","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC - &nbsp;Medicaid per capita cap legislation&nbsp;threatens state initiatives to improve care integration and&nbsp;to keep more seniors and disabled Americans in their&nbsp;homes,&nbsp;according to an issue brief released today by the National Coalition on Health Care entitled “Medicare at Risk?<br>Exploring the Implications of Medicaid Per Capita Caps for Medicare and Its Beneficiaries.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“By squeezing state Medicaid budgets, legislative per capita&nbsp;cap proposals, like those before the Congress now, could actually&nbsp;impede&nbsp;the very innovations and reforms that these Medicare beneficiaries and tax payers need,”&nbsp;stated NCHC President and CEO John Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The newly released brief draws on both recent&nbsp;analysis of per capita cap proposals&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;an April 10, 2017&nbsp;panel event sponsored by NCHC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;key findings outlined in the issue brief are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>1 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries also rely on Medicaid. They tend to have more complex and costly care needs than the average.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>State Medicaid programs are now investing in significant reforms of care for this dually eligible population.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Per capita cap legislation would create a gap between the cost of care&nbsp;and the state’s per capita cap - squeezing&nbsp;state Medicaid budgets and programs for duals.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Under this pressure, states could reverse their investments in home- and community-based services&nbsp;and&nbsp;shift utilization and costs back towards acute and post-acute services covered by Medicare.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Over time, the fiscal pressure generated by per capita caps could&nbsp;push states back toward&nbsp;institutionalization and unnecessary hospitalization&nbsp;as the primary response to aging and disability,”&nbsp;said Rother.&nbsp;“That’s just not an acceptable outcome - for beneficiaries or for our nation’s fiscal future.”</p>

1110,"Medical, Consumer, Insurer Groups Call for Immediate Individual Market Stabilization Package","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC - Today, twenty-four organizations called on Congressional leadership to pass legislation relating to reinsurance and stability of the individual health insurance markets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our nation’s individual insurance markets face increased cost-sharing and growing premiums, Congress needs to act immediately to&nbsp;stabilize this situation and improve affordability - starting with robust federal funding for reinsurance.” urged John Rother, President and CEO of NCHC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC was joined on the letter by AARP, the Healthcare Leadership Council (a coalition of healthcare CEOs), and an array of other business, health plan, medical, nursing, pension fund, provider, faith and consumer organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter and full signatory list can be found&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NCHC_Reinsurance-sign-on-letter-FINAL-3.12.18.pdf"">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McCarthy, Leader Pelosi, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We write to urge rapid, bipartisan action to stabilize the nation’s health insurance markets and prevent cost increases for American families. The undersigned organizations are associations of large and small employers, consumer and patient advocacy groups, health plans, health systems, advocates for health quality and safety, faith groups, associations representing physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals, pension funds, and labor unions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The nation’s individual health insurance markets are facing growing challenges. The past year has brought destabilizing uncertainty that has driven up premiums and cost-sharing across the country. Premiums climbed by 17% in 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average silver plan deductible has reached $4034. The recently enacted elimination of individual mandate penalties could accelerate these trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These circumstances require an immediate response. We call on Congress to enact legislation, built around robust federal funding for reinsurance that is adequate to ensure stability, encourage competition and lower costs for consumers while maintaining the core consumer protections in current federal statute. Reinsurance provisions of this legislation should be structured in a manner to bring relief to consumers in every state. To assure its sustainability, any legislative solution must be bipartisan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the 17 million Americans who depend on individually purchased health insurance for their health security, we appeal to you to demonstrate the leadership this moment requires. With rate filings for health plans participating in the Marketplaces due next month, the time for further debate has expired. The time for action is now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Sincerely,</p>

1112,"Medical Malpractice Reform","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical Malpractice lawsuits cost the system $54.4 billion per year, which is 2.4 percent of total health care spending. A large amount of medical malpractice awards are usurped by legal fees and administrative costs and thus do not end up with the injured patient. There is an urgent need for medical malpractice reform to ensure the patient receives a just reward, curb the rising cost of health care and foster better patient-centered outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent demonstrations at the University of Michigan, Ascension Health and several other hospital systems throughout the country have produced positive outcomes since adopting the Disclosure, Apology and Offer approach to medical liability. At the University of Michigan Health System, when a patient injury occurs the Health System immediately discusses the situation with the patient and family. Subsequently, the risk management department conducts an investigation into the injury and apologizes for the mistake. Finally, the Health System offers compensation if the investigation proves that a medical error caused the injury. The idea behind the “apology” approach is that better communication between doctors and patients will decrease health care costs and improve patient satisfaction. This initiative has fostered an atmosphere of communication and full disclosure and has enhanced the ability of the staff to learn from past experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since adopting the Disclosure, Apology and Offer method there have been fewer lawsuits, lower liability costs, less patient compensation and a faster resolution to claims. &nbsp;Specifically, it has cut litigation costs by $2 million per year and medical liability claims have decreased by 40 percent. The University of Michigan attributes some of the success of this program to the state of Michigan’s medical malpractice reform legislation which creates a mandatory 6 month “cooling-off” period during which both the plaintiff and the defendant must think about the case before going to court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that many health systems have shown that apologizing for their mistakes rather than jumping into a litigation battle lowers health care costs, we are forced to wonder why more are not adopting this technique. Is there some sort of legislation that the state or federal government could adopt that would encourage other hospitals to try the “apology” approach? This approach has garnered some support from the American Medical Association due to its positive impact on reducing costs and improving care. Without at least tacit approval, however, from groups such as the Trial Lawyers Association, it will be difficult to pass legislation that encourages any sort of malpractice reform. In the meantime, we can hope that more hospital systems will take the initiative to adopt an “apology” approach and begin to change the medical malpractice culture.</p>

<p>The medical societies, and the consumer and business advocates supporting them, like AARP, Consumer Reports, and the National Business Group on Health, have acknowledged that when we waste precious health care dollars on tests and procedures that patients don’t need, it both undermines patient care and makes our health system less affordable.&nbsp; And perhaps more importantly, the Choosing Wisely effort recognizes that physicians and patients share a responsibility to curb these wasteful, unnecessary practices.</p>

<p>Nearly one in three Medicare beneficiaries exercise their option to receive their Medicare benefits through Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans and Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs). In addition to providing important coverage choices, a well-functioning MA program can do much more. In fact, the MA program can contribute mightily to health care delivery and payment reform. However, only in a policy environment that supports innovative, high-value care will Medicare Advantage realize its full potential.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The following steps are essential:</p>

<li>Ensure MA payment accounts for the real costs of patient care, especially for frail and other high-cost populations.</li>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>1 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries also rely on Medicaid. These 11 million enrollees tend to have more complex care needs and account for greater expenditures than the average Medicare beneficiary. They are often referred to as dually eligible beneficiaries.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>State Medicaid programs are now investing in significant reforms of care for this dually eligible population, focused on substituting improved care coordination and less-intensive, more person-centered interventions, including home- and community-based services (HCBS), for the major expenses associated with future, downstream hospital and specialty care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Medicaid per capita cap legislation would result in a gap between each state’s statutorily determined capped amount and the changing cost of care—generating greater overall budget pressure on state Medicaid programs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Under this pressure, states would have an incentive to roll back their ongoing investments in these Medicaid reform initiatives—shifting costs and utilization back toward the Medicare programs’ hospital and post-acute benefits</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->"
1122,"The Medicare Affordability and Enrollment Act of 2016","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On September 21, Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee,&nbsp;Congressman Frank Pallone, the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce&nbsp;Committee and Congressman Sander Levin, the ranking member of House Ways and Means&nbsp;Committee, along with several of their Democratic colleagues, introduced “The Medicare&nbsp;Affordability and Enrollment Act of 2016” (S. 3371 and H.R. 6109), which would update the&nbsp;Medicare program to improve both beneficiary affordability and the enrollment process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generations of Americans owe a lot to the Medicare program, for the security and peace of&nbsp;mind that has provided to millions of disabled and elderly Americans and their families, who&nbsp;don’t have to worry if basic medical care will be covered for their loved ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there is no question that this bill – and other changes to Medicare — are overdue. So much&nbsp;of how Medicare operates has not changed much since the program was created in 1965, and&nbsp;the out-of- pocket costs and outdated enrollment procedures need to be modernized. For&nbsp;example, the legislation would create an out-of- pocket cap for traditional Medicare which&nbsp;already exists for Medicare Advantage and most commercial insurance plans. It would also&nbsp;streamline the enrollment system to make enrollment easier, and reduce late-enrollment&nbsp;penalties that are now paid in perpetuity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this bill does not come cheap, and there are other changes that need to be made to&nbsp;Medicare beyond this legislation if we truly want to bring the program into the 21 st century.&nbsp;Today, too many Medicare dollars are paid on the basis of the volume of services, not for high&nbsp;quality care, for good outcomes, or for value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is good work being done at CMS, on Capitol Hill and around the country to make&nbsp;Medicare more efficient and more sustainable. At CMS and the Center for Medicare and&nbsp;Medicaid Innovation, much has been done on bundled payments, ACOs, on Value Based&nbsp;Insurance Design, implementing MACRA and developing alternative payment models for&nbsp;physicians to name but a few. Members of Congress are hard at work on bills like “The&nbsp;Medicare Affordability and Enrollment Act of 2016” and “Medicare Post-Acute Value-Based&nbsp;Purchasing Act of 2015,” not to mention the Senate Finance Committee’s Chronic Care Working&nbsp;Group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it will be soon be time for Congress to move legislation designed to achieve greater&nbsp;affordability and value in Medicare….to look for ways to deliver better care at lower costs in&nbsp;provider reimbursement AND in benefit design as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need a new Medicare paradigm, one that focuses on affordability, value and innovation;&nbsp;one that can keep up with our ever changing health care system. Senator Wyden’s legislation is&nbsp;one crucial part of creating that paradigm, but there is much more that needs to done.</p>

<p><strong>Medicare’s Latest Primary Care Initiative a Major Step Forward</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement by NCHC President and CEO John Rother on the announcement of the new Comprehensive Primary Care Plus multi-payer advanced primary care initiative</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The new model for primary care payment announced today is a major step forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<a href=""https://pcpcc.org/2016/02/02/new-report-finds-medical-homes-improve-health-care-quality-costs-utilization"">Strong and substantial evidence</a>&nbsp;shows that a better approach to primary care can improve care and lower costs, if properly structured and supported.&nbsp;As a result, the best private and public employers and commercial plans are investing in advanced primary care payment models.&nbsp; But the bulk of Medicare practices have been largely dependent on pure fee-for-service payment, and many have struggled to achieve real practice transformation. With today’s announcement, that will begin to change for thousands of health professionals and millions of patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Of course, the details of implementation will matter a great deal. CMS must prove itself flexible enough to engage non-federal payers in diverse areas of the country. Model participants must find ways to effectively work with specialty practices. Policymakers must determine how this model can best interface with last year’s SGR reform legislation and the Medicare Shared Savings Program, as well as health plans in Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp;And ultimately, the full range of payers must press toward development, refinement and dissemination of even more ambitious alternative payment models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But for today, it’s clear that Medicare and Medicaid are moving to align their primary care payment models with the rest of the health care sector. That’s a big deal.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

1135,"MedPage Today: Group Unveils National Primary Care Strategy","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON — Payment models involving primary care should build on proven methods, be innovative and prevent patients from losing access, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">National Coalition on Health Care</a>&nbsp;said at a briefing Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NCHC’s national strategy specifically includes continuing to improve chronic care management code in Medicare’s Physician Fee Schedule, integrating primary care and behavioral health training and payment, and making “Comprehensive Primary Care Plus and&nbsp;<a href=""https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/independence-at-home/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Independence at Home</a>&nbsp;models available to practices nationally.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, it calls for implementing MACRA’s (the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act) MIPS (Merit-Based Incentive Payment System) and Alternative Payment model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding innovation, the NCHC recommended ensuring CMS is able to continue testing new alternative payment models, and to refine and expand any such models that reduce costs and/or improve outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Addressing access, the NCHC recommended ensuring affordable private coverage, maintaining federal support for state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance programs, and continuing to minimize the number of Americans without coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An NCHC fact sheet also espoused the value of primary care: “To build an American health care (sic) system that delivers better care at a lower cost, primary care must become a national health policy priority.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two previous blog posts, we have discussed some of the ideas and approaches to health care reform in the House Republicans “A Better Way” plan where NCHC shares common ground (and also expressing our opposition of outright repeal of the Affordable Care Act). In this blog post, however, we want to talk about a couple ideas with regard to Medicaid where we do not agree; where we, in fact, have very serious reservations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A Better Way” would give states the option to choose either a block grant or a per capita cap for their Medicaid programs, both of which we are strongly opposed to. Both ideas have been around for decades. And there are good reasons why neither has been enacted into law, even when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A Better Way” points to the growth in Medicaid spending as to why block grants and per capita caps are warranted: The report says that “during fiscal year 2016, federal and state Medicaid outlays are expected to be approximately $545 billion. Today, Medicaid accounts for more than 15 percent of all health care spending in the United States and plays an increasingly large role in our nation’s health care system.“ What is does not say is that per capita spending in Medicaid is actually lower compared to private insurers after adjusting for the greater health needs of the Medicaid population. A 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation study found that if a low-income adult Medicaid enrollee were instead covered by private health insurance, spending would be over 25 percent higher. Growth in Medicaid spending is driven by growth in enrollment, not because it is an inefficient system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A block grant – which would give states a lump sum of money to run their Medicaid programs, with few, if any, strings or requirements attached — may sound like a good way to control health care costs, but it does so on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens: low-income children, mothers, the poor and frail elderly. By capping what the federal government gives to state Medicaid programs, there is every reason to believe that states will reduce benefits, restrict coverage, and cut payments to providers. Those strategies might save the federal government money, but could over the long-term impose significant cost on state economies and taxpayers. For example, states would be left holding the bag if an economic downturn floods the Medicaid rolls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though often touted as an alternative to block grants, per capita caps in Medicaid are also a bad idea. Under this approach, the federal government would give states a set amount of money per enrollee. It differs from a block grant in that it is not a fixed amount of money, but rather pays per enrollee, no matter how many people are enrolled so it would protect states against unexpected surges in enrollment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A Better Way” would calculate separate caps for four subpopulations (aged, blind and disabled, children and adults); caps would be calculated the first year and only adjusted for general inflation after that. Historically, health care cost growth has far outpaced general inflation, even when health care costs slowed during the recent recession. Tying adjustments to general inflation virtually guarantees a cap that does not keep pace with health care costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Per capita caps would not protect against higher than expected costs that could arise from a jump in chronic disease (think opioid addiction), outbreak of a communicable disease (think Zika) or the arrival of a high-priced, but life-saving drug or device (think recent Hepatitis C drugs). So here too, any money the federal government saves will be at the expense of the states. And states, in turn, would turn to curbing benefits, restricting coverage or further cutting provider payment for children, pregnant mothers, disabled beneficiaries, the poor and frail elders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We acknowledge that Medicaid is a major investment for states. And we are concerned that the escalating health care costs that are squeezing families, employers and Medicare today are also wreaking havoc on state budgets. The answer is to do the hard work of finding systemic efficiencies for the entire health system, not reduce needed access solely for the most vulnerable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our health care system is facing any number of challenges. I know that House Republicans want to address as many of these problems as they can, and there are ideas in “A Better Way’ that NCHC can support. But on some of the biggest problems facing our system – such as making Medicaid more affordable and cost-efficient – it is time for some new thinking. And there may be many Republicans who might agree.</p>

<h1>Examining Selected Proposals in ‘A Better Way to Fix Health Care’</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JULY 14, 2016&nbsp;BY&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/author/nisha/"">NISHA BHAT</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 22, the House Health Care Reform Task Force, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan, released their blueprint describing how the House Republican caucus’ hopes to reform our country’s health care system, entitled “A Better Way to Fix Health Care.” There is much in their approach that we at NCHC do not support.&nbsp; To name just a few examples, there is nothing particularly appealing about proposals to repeal the entirety of the ACA, roll back federal support for Medicaid and CHIP, raise Medicare’s eligibility age or shutdown the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s crucial work on alternative payment models.&nbsp; We’ll have more to say on these issues in later blog posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are ideas in the package that, properly developed, could improve our health care system. So we begin today by taking a close look at a few constructive proposals included in the report’s Medicare section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We agree with the House Health Care Reform Task Force that while the Medicare program has successfully served America’s seniors and disabled for over 50 years, “the program faces notable challenges, including a complex financial structure and projected spending growth that make the program unsustainable for the long term.” These challenges may not be an immediate emergency—in part due to slower growth in Medicare spending per person since 2010.&nbsp; But additional steps to get health care costs under control – in Medicare and across our health care system – remain crucial for the economic future of this country. There are recommendations in “A Better Way” that would move us closer to a better and more efficient Medicare program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC supports giving Medicare Advantage (MA) plans the flexibility to design benefits that are customized for the populations they serve – also known as value-based insurance design (VBID).&nbsp; VBID would allow plans to tailor cost-sharing and supplemental benefits to specific population needs.&nbsp;For example, a plan that wanted to better serve beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions could lower co-pays for care management and post-hospital care to encourage their use.&nbsp;Similar flexibility should be granted to certain alternative payment models under Original Medicare. Strong oversight and beneficiary protections need to be in place.&nbsp; But on the whole, this is one approach to Medicare whose time has come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A Better Way” also proposes to create a pathway to compare quality in MA and fee-for-service (FFS). Ensuring that beneficiaries can make better-informed choices represents a constructive start toward bipartisan Medicare policy, provided that actual legislation really does level the playing field between MA and Original Medicare, rather than tilt it in one direction or another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The House package goes on to urge combining Medicare Parts A and B – creating a single combined deductible, establishing an annual maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) cap, and aligning low-income protections with Medicare Part D.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only would the proposal seek to simplify and streamline Medicare, it would – again – create more parity between MA and FFS, as MA plans are already required to provide an OOP cap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the details matter a great deal with any redesign of Medicare benefits. Similar proposals have floundered when combined with significant new restrictions on supplemental coverage (also included in the Republican proposal) or when savings were to be redirected to other purposes.&nbsp; But if “A Better Way” is seen as an opening bid—not the final word—perhaps a redesign that actually improves Medicare for beneficiaries could be a topic for discussion in the next Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To conclude, while there are many details to be ironed out in each of these areas, Speaker Ryan and his team deserve credit for some fresh ideas that have the potential to improve Medicare. We look forward to working with the Speaker and his colleagues in both parties to strengthen our health care system.</p>

<p>In our blog post on July 14, we talked about some of the provisions in the House Republican Health Care Task Force’s health reform proposal — entitled “A Better Way” — that NCHC believes would modernize and improve the Medicare program for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. In later posts, we will turn a critical eye toward their plans for the children, seniors, and low-income adults who depend on Medicaid and CHIP.&nbsp; But today, we identify some elements of the Task Force’s coverage and innovation proposals that represent good starting points for future dialogue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an organization, NCHC has long been committed to finding common ground solutions to our health care challenges. And&nbsp; “A Better Way” does provide some room for future conversation. The Task Force report opens with the following quote: “Americans deserve an accessible and affordable health care system that promotes quality care and peace of mind. It should empower patients and support innovation.”&nbsp; We could not agree more with these goals.&nbsp; After all, the National Coalition on Health Care was established to support efforts for better and more affordable coverage for all Americans, and we too believe our health care system should focus on patient-centered, high quality health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But potential for common ground extends beyond the shared vision with which the report opens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The House Republican Health Care Task Force goes on to embrace widely accepted consumer protections:&nbsp; coverage for dependents under age 26 on their parents’ plan, bans on lifetime and yearly coverage caps, protection from rescission or non-renewal of coverage and protection for patients with pre-existing conditions.&nbsp; The proposed safeguards are not as comprehensive as the ACA’s, but it is significant that, for all the disagreements over the 2010 law, there is now bipartisan agreement that federal policy should extend certain basic consumer protections to every American health care consumer. In another important step, “A Better Way” also endorses an advance-able, refundable tax credit to help those not on Medicaid or an affordable employer-based plan coverage. However, here as well, the House Republican approach is substantially different from the ACA’s and could prove substantially less generous for some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC also agrees with the Task Force on the importance of supporting and facilitating innovation. The report hits it on the mark when it suggests Healthcare Information Technology (HIT) policy must move “toward interoperability and exchange of information.”&nbsp; Payers, providers and American taxpayers all have made expensive investments in new technology intended to move our archaic paper-based system into the 21st Century.&nbsp; Unfortunately, silo-ed HIT systems still prevent providers from exchanging the information they need to coordinate and deliver the best care.&nbsp; We also agree on the importance of investments in medical research, though we would simultaneously stress the need to keep those treatments affordable and to support treatments which deliver better outcomes than existing therapies or treat patients at a lower cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, NCHC shares the Task Force’s view that states can be effective laboratories for innovation. “A Better Way” backs a pair of medical liability reform ideas, safe harbors for following clinical practice guidelines and health courts, which may have the potential to lower costs and improve care.&nbsp; The proposed State Innovation Grants could also prove to be an intriguing pathway to promote broader state-level reform, especially if they are viewed as complements to existing&nbsp; Section 1115 and Section 1332 authorities which allow waivers of Medicaid and ACA provisions when states can present a better plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one crucial area where we differ with the House Republican Health Care Task Force is this: NCHC recognizes that since 2010, the United States has already moved closer to realizing the very affordability, accessibility and quality goals with which ”A Better Way” begins.&nbsp; For all its faults, the Affordable Care Act has been integral to this undeniable progress: the uninsured rate at an all-time low of 9.1 percent (compared to 16.7 percent in 2013), improved financial protection for those who are insured, and slower-than-projected growth in Medicare spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this, NCHC is far from alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even respected House and Senate Republicans as well as conservative thought leaders like the Manhattan Institute’s Avik Roy and the American Enterprise Institute’s Thomas Miller are now advancing alternatives to complete repeal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of starting from scratch, we should focus our energy on what more can be done to build on recent coverage gains and, just as importantly, to make health care more affordable for consumers, employers and taxpayers. If that becomes our shared focus, “A Better Way” provides a great deal to talk about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the “devil is in the details” as Washingtonians are fond of saying. But as we said last week, we look forward to working with House Republicans other members of Congress and the administration to find more common ground moving forward.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC — Today, experts from across the political spectrum called on Congress to replace the Medicare’s sustainable growth rate (SGR) physician payment formula with approaches that promote higher- value care instead of greater volume of services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In letters sent to the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, thought leaders from conservative, progressive, and centrist think tanks united with nonpartisan stakeholder groups to urge SGR reform that establishes a clear path to new payment models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In previously released work and policy recommendations, several of the signatories have proposed permanent SGR repeal with delivery and payment reforms that curb costs and improve quality, but today’s letter is the first joint expression of that position from the signatories. Absent congressional action this year, the SGR payment formula is scheduled to impose a 24% pay cut on physicians and a range of other Medicare providers on&nbsp; January 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The full texts of the letters are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Chairman Baucus, Chairman Camp, Ranking Member Levin, and Senator Hatch:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consensus on difficult issues of health care policy is exceedingly rare. But we write as individuals and organizations from across the political spectrum united around a key principle: that Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) mechanism must be replaced with reforms to the payment and delivery system that help lower the rate of growth in health care costs while improving the quality of care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specifically, any repeal of the SGR must establish a clear path to new payment models that support value and accountability for quality and costs. Congress could establish such a path in one of two ways:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish a timeline for Medicare to phase in new payment models for a gradually increasing share of Medicare’s spending; and/or</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish a timeline for Medicare to phase in strong financial incentives for physicians to adopt one of several alternative payment models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only would such a path vastly improve the health care system, but it would also help hold down Medicare expenditures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Repeal of the SGR offers a real opportunity to reform the payment and delivery system – one that should not be missed. We stand ready to support you in making this critical reform, which will lower costs for both the government and seniors, improve the quality of care, and catalyze change throughout the health care system.</p>

<p><strong>Experts Make a Business Case for Pursuing Medication Adherence Initiatives<br></strong><em>NCHC Forum on Capitol Hill Features Medication Adherence Successes</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) convened a Capitol Hill Forum today featuring experts on initiatives to increase medication adherence —an area for improving health outcomes and lowering costs that the event’s organizers believe has been underexplored by both policymakers and purchasers of health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Efforts to improve medication adherence fall in the rare and precious budget terrain of initiatives that can produce a ‘win-win’ for all stakeholders—consumers, providers, payers alike. Greater adherence by patients to prescribed regimens could both increase medication use and lower total health care costs by improving outcomes from medication therapy,” explained John Rother, President and CEO of NCHC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite its benefits, proper adherence to prescribed medication regimens, particularly for treatment of chronic diseases, is remarkably low. Recent studies show that 20 to 30 percent of prescriptions are never filled, and 50 percent of medications are not taken as prescribed. Non-adherence costs the US health care system between $100 and $289 billion a year in direct costs.<a href=""https://nchc.org/#_ftn1""></a>[1]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Clearly we have both a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous challenge,” said Rother. “The opportunity is the substantial savings that could be achieved by improving patients’ health.&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge is finding sustainable interventions that can be scaled up to improve medication adherence, produce better health outcomes, and lower costs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event’s speakers all have experience with successful initiatives to improve adherence. They included Josh Benner, PharmD, ScD, President and CEO of RxAnte; Troy Trygstad, PharmD, MBA, PhD, Director of the Network Pharmacist Program at Community Care of North Carolina; Brian K. Solow, MD, Chief Medical Officer of OptumRx; and Sachin Jain, MD, Chief Medical Information and Innovation Officer of Merck and Co.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Evidence suggests that self-management of chronic diseases could save $10 for every $1 spent.<a href=""https://nchc.org/#_ftn2""></a><sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;To realize those savings, we are going to have to build on the successes of the programs featured at today’s forum,” concluded Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC has offered its own specific recommendations to improve medication adherence, which can be found in the organization’s recently released plan for health and fiscal policy—<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/NCHC%20Plan%20for%20Health%20and%20Fiscal%20Policy.pdf""><em>Curbing Costs, Improving Care: The Path to an Affordable Health Care Future</em></a>.</p>

1290,"Multi-stakeholder Coalition Applauds Legislation to Provide Affordable Health Care to All Americans","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Washington, DC –&nbsp;</strong>Yesterday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Energy &amp; Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), Ways &amp; Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA), and Education &amp; Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott (D-VA) released a joint statement announcing that H.R. 3, the&nbsp;<em>Lower Drug Costs Now Act</em>, will come to a floor vote next week. The National Coalition on Health Care supports H.R. 3 to lower prescription drug prices and urges its swift passage to the U.S. Senate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“We applaud the U.S. House Leadership for their support in targeting the explosive rise in pharmaceutical costs in America,”</strong>&nbsp;said John Rother, President of the National Coalition on Health Care.&nbsp;<strong>“It is time Congress acted to provide tangible relief to millions of Americans who cannot afford the drugs they need.”</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A recent study by the Healthcare Value Hub found that U.S. prescription drug prices increased by an average of 24.9 percent from 2012 to 2016, far outpacing other drivers of health care costs, and prescription drug spending by Americans increased by 27.2 percent during the same time period. Research shows that health care price growth is the leading reason for high healthcare spending in America, and a 2017 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation revealed that nearly one-third of the U.S. population has gone without needed medical care due to cost concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>H.R. 3 addresses these problems by allowing the government to negotiate prices for a select list of drugs on which we spend the most, and cap capricious increases on pharmaceutical prices. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reportedly estimates that drug negotiations in H.R. 3 would save $500 billion over a decade – savings that could be used for other health or non-health spending. An official estimate is slated to release next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care urges swift passage of this legislation to the U.S. Senate to ensure all Americans receive the necessary health care they need at an affordable cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
1291,"National Coalition Expresses Disappointment in 2019 Year-End Package, “Surprise Billing” and Drug Prices Missing","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care expresses significant disappointment that&nbsp;<em>Congress did not act in 2019 to protect Americans from surprise medical bills or from high prescription drug prices.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although we applaud the inclusion of CREATES Act in the final year-end spending package, which will help provide a boost to the generic drugs market, the end of the year package lacks any significant changes to drug policy that would protect Americans from the most expensive drugs. Americans have consistently indicated that high and increasing drug prices are the top concern, across both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Congress failed to act on “surprise” medical bills, despite bipartisan support to protect patient and a readily available compromise for providers and plans. Patients deserve better than for Congress to bend to private equity and providers who wish to exploit the complexity of our health care system for their benefit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We urge Congress to act swiftly and with a sense of urgency in 2020 to protect patients from harmful drug prices and surprise bills.</p>

1293,"National Coalition on Health Care Calls on Senate to Take Alternative Course to Address Health Care Affordability","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), an alliance of leading health care provider, payer, and consumer organizations, called on the Senate to pursue an alternative, bipartisan path forward on health care following the House of Representatives’ recent passage of HR 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, NCHC calls for rapid legislative action to stabilize existing coverage and curb costs, along with a longer-term effort to craft a bipartisan compromise that improves on current law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The fundamental problem that needs to be addressed is the rising cost of care for families as well as the government,” stated NCHC President and CEO John Rother. “Congress should be tackling that now, even as we work toward common ground on health care reform.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Extensions of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and primary care programs, mandatory appropriations for cost-sharing reductions (CSR’s), pharmaceutical reforms, Medicare chronic care reform, and stable funding for prevention are among the specific recommendations laid out in the letter.</p>

1295,"National Coalition on Health Care and West Health, The Burden of High Drug Prices on Communities of Color","<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The disproportionate toll of the coronavirus pandemic on communities of color has forced our nation to reckon with disparities that have long predated COVID-1</strong><strong>9</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last month, the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) and West Health held a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/events/nchc-west-health-public-hill-briefing-on-drug-pricing-2/"">virtual Hill briefing</a>&nbsp;exploring the link between the high cost of drugs and health inequities on March 18, 2021. The briefing explored a range of systemic issues that drive health inequities for communities of color, including drug prices, coverage gaps, and COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The disproportionate toll of the coronavirus pandemic on communities of color has forced our nation to reckon with disparities that have long predated COVID-19,” remarked keynote speaker&nbsp;<strong><em>Congresswoman Lauren Underwood (D-IL)</em></strong>. For example, Black mothers are three to four times more likely to die due to pregnancy related complications compared to white mothers. Disproportionate rates of asthma in Hispanic children, diabetes in American Indian and Alaskan Native adults, and cancer in Asian Islanders are signs of health disparities that must be addressed. Today, this is reflected in unjustly high counts of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and death rates in communities of color.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Congressman Steven Horsford (D-NV)</em></strong>’s concluding remarks highlighted how people of color have been affected by COVID-19 because they are largely on the front lines of the virus. He shared that “data on vaccine hesitancy and prescription drug costs reinforce what we already know; health disparities and historic racism in our medical system are making it harder to crush COVID-19”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adults of color in non-expansion states are 88% more likely to suffer 12-month medication insecurity</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latest data on access to prescription drugs vividly illustrate these disparities. West Health released new findings from their&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WH_Gallup_BurdenofHighDrugPricesInfographic_March2021-002.pdf"">January poll</a>&nbsp;on drug accessibility and costs, in collaboration with Gallup.&nbsp;<strong><em>Tim Lash, Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of West Health</em></strong>&nbsp;showed that many families are facing tradeoffs they should not have to make: 4 in 10 households with at least one prescription reported skipping pills. While high prices of drugs have affected all populations, West Health noticed a higher rate of skipping pills in communities of color, notably Hispanic adults.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The survey also found that drug costs impact communities of color in states that have not expanded Medicaid the most –&nbsp;<strong>in fact, adults of color in non-expansion states are 88% more likely to suffer 12-month medication insecurity</strong>. Further, the number of seniors dying because they cannot afford their medication illustrates the toxic effect of high prescription drug cost. West Health found that 120,000 Medicare beneficiaries die annually from medication non-adherence. Therefore, even those with health coverage are at risk of poor health outcomes due to high costs. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Importantly, the West Health poll confirmed earlier research by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-october-2019/"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>&nbsp;that addressing high drug costs is popular across political parties. In fact, two-thirds of adults reported that lowering the cost of drugs and health insurance premiums should be high priority for the Biden Administration, regardless of party affiliation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Sean Dickson, Health Policy Director at West Health, held a panel discussion with Dr. Amber Hewitt, now Chief Equity Officer for the District of Columbia, and David Certner of AARP.&nbsp;</em></strong>The panel discussed policy proposals to curb the growth of drug costs, including Medicare negotiating rates directly with manufacturers, international reference pricing, and cost sharing caps. Dr. Hewitt shared the importance of having an intersectional health equity lens on drug pricing and health care affordability, citing both sexual orientation and geography as other factors to consider alongside race. In terms of solutions, both panelists agreed that just capping cost sharing fails to address the root of the issue, and instead may result in higher premiums. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The effort to lower prescription drug costs is inextricably linked to health equity</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Structural barriers that drive health inequity go beyond health care as well.&nbsp;<strong><em>Jamal Watkins, Vice President of Civic Engagement at the NAACP,</em></strong>&nbsp;commented: “There [are] also other policies connected and rooted in other fights that still have a connection to a whole culture of health.” He highlighted how access to transportation, housing, clean air, and water indirectly impacts the framework related to affordable prescription drugs. Importantly Jamal Watkins named public policy the greatest equalizer in regard to racial inequalities, urging viewers to turn to policy as a solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effort to lower prescription drug costs is inextricably linked to health equity, in addition to other health policy endeavors. NCHC looks forward to collaborating with the speakers and congressional leaders like Representatives Horsford and Underwood to find sustainable solutions that address the high cost of drugs as part of our mission to create an affordable health care system for all.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“The President’s proposal, while only a framework for Congress’ consideration, establishes the priorities of the Administration. NCHC is concerned that the priorities of the Administration do not serve public health and do not align with the mission of the Coalition.<br><br>Safety net and public health programs are critical to improving population health, addressing cost drivers, and achieving sustainability. The President’s budget relies in part on significant reductions in federal spending on Medicaid, which serves as an important safety net for disabled and low-income Americans. Further, the President’s budget also proposes cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health research. These proposals will undermine the health of all Americans.<br><br>NCHC urges Congress to preserve the country’s investments in Medicaid and public health. We should work together to lower health care costs by cutting waste, improving incentives, and improving quality, not by spending cuts that harm the public’s health and the most vulnerable.”</p>

<p><em>New Campaign Will Put a Spotlight on Abuse of Market Power in Drug Pricing and Risks to Patients, Taxpayers, and Future Innovation</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington DC – The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), today launched the “Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing” to spotlight what the group characterizes as “unsustainable and abusive” prices for some medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Campaign is led by NCHC President and CEO John Rother and aims to spark a national dialogue about the need to find market-based solutions to the problems caused by the onslaught of new high-priced prescription medicines. Rother pointed specifically to Sovaldi, a drug manufactured by Gilead Pharmaceuticals and used to treat patients with hepatitis C, that has drawn the ire of employers, consumer groups, state Medicaid programs, public health advocates, and payers. The drug is priced at $84,000 per 12 week treatment — or $1,000 per pill, and is often combined with other treatments bringing the total cost closer to $150,000 per patient.</p>

<p><em>Statement&nbsp;by NCHC President and CEO John Rother regarding the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“We need health care that is more affordable for all, but according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the current House plan moves us in the opposite direction. &nbsp;It is time for a fresh start.”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care, a nonpartisan alliance of over 90 patient, payer,&nbsp; purchaser and provider organizations&nbsp;representing more than 150 million Americans, urges Congress to reject the current House budget reconciliation proposal and pursue a different approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to CBO’s independent analysis, the House plan would have the following real-world results:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>21 million fewer Americans with health care insurance in 2020 and 24 million fewer in 2026</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A 60% lower tax credit for eligible individuals purchasing non-group coverage in 2020</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>An $880 billion cut in federal support for state Medicaid programs over the next ten years- effectively shifting these costs to states, their taxpayers, providers and beneficiaries</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also know from an&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CMS%20Medicare%20solvency%20letter%20Final%20Signed.pdf"">earlier Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary analysis&nbsp;</a>that the House plan’s&nbsp;repeal of the 0.9% increase in the Medicare payroll tax for certain high-income taxpayers&nbsp;would mean three fewer years until the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund’s projected insolvency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These outcomes would impose very high costs on American families and block ongoing reform initiatives that move us toward a more affordable system. &nbsp;We are particularly concerned that $880 billion in cuts due to reduced federal support for Medicaid expansion states, changes to Medicaid’s financing structure and cuts to home- and community-based services would imperil many positive delivery reforms that hold promise for a better performing, lower cost health system. Changes of this magnitude are also likely to disrupt the ability of physician practices, hospitals, nursing homes, community health centers, and mental health and substance abuse treatment providers to remain open and furnish needed care for patients with all types of insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC advocates a fresh approach to fixing what’s broken in American health care. After taking reasonable steps to stabilize the non-group market (the proposed State and Patient Stability Fund represents one worthwhile idea),&nbsp;Congress should focus&nbsp;on addressing the underlying causes of high health care costs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>waste and unnecessary care,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the high costs of&nbsp;prescription drugs,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the lack of coordinated care for high-cost patients,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Inadequate support for&nbsp;primary care, resulting in avoidable specialty care, hospital stays and institutionalization,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>lack of investment in population health.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These five factors drive high costs without adding value, and are a more constructive focus for efforts to move our health system toward better performance and more affordable costs for everyone. NCHC is ready to work with the Congress and the Administration on an economically sustainable and politically achievable plan.”</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The movement to value-based payment models, a bipartisan effort, began 15 years ago with&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/as-macra-ramps-up-study-says-no-evidence-pay-for-performance-improves-outcomes"">pay-for-performance</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/topic/bundled-payments"">bundled payments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/experts-split-effectiveness-accountable-care-organizations"">accountable care organization models</a>. And healthcare providers, clinicians and insurers invested heavily to move healthcare in this direction,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.premierinc.com/healthcare-leaders-congress-administration-improve-value-based-care-movement/"">noted</a>&nbsp;Premier, an alliance of 3,750 hospitals and more than 130,000 other provider organizations,&nbsp;in an announcement about the letter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The movement, Premier said, is finally&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/steady-improvement-for-medicare-acos-despite-exits"">starting</a>&nbsp;to generate results, pointing to Medicare ACOs savings of $1.29 billion since 2012 while improving quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Through private and public sector alignment, the move toward value-based care is succeeding, measurably improving healthcare quality and contributing to historically low costs. Now is not the time for policymakers to signal a shift away from value-based care, either through action or inaction,” they wrote in the letter.</p>

<h3>By John Rother</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Medicare is inefficient and fails to control costs.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trustees of Medicare last year&nbsp;projected&nbsp;that the program’s share of gross domestic product would increase from the current 3.7&nbsp;percent to about 5 percent in 2030 and nearly 6 percent by 2050. But since Medicare’s inception in 1965, its spending growth, on a per-person basis, has stayed consistent with or lower than the increase in private health insurance premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Congressional Budget Office&nbsp;recently predicted&nbsp;that per capita Medicare spending will grow 1&nbsp;percent faster than the rate of inflation over the next decade. The CBO attributes the slower projected trend in Medicare spending to the enactment of President Obama’s health-care overhaul, which reduced high payments to Medicare HMOs, and to the anticipated influx of younger, healthier baby boomers, which will lower the average cost per beneficiary. Medicare enrollment is projected to accelerate over the next 25 years, from 47.5 million today to 80 million in 2030.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The addition of baby boomers is the single largest factor in Medicare’s projected spending growth over the next few decades. In the short term, this shouldn’t be a problem, but as that vast generation ages, if systemwide health-care costs don’t come down, it will be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;The well-off don’t pay enough for their Medicare benefits.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many assume that Medicare has uniform requirements for contributing to the program, placing an unfair burden on most participants and not asking enough of upper-income seniors. This is no longer the case. Wealthier people pay more than others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare Part A — hospital insurance — is financed through a 2.9&nbsp;percent tax on earnings paid by employers and employees (1.45&nbsp;percent each). In 1993, Congress lifted the cap on income so that individuals who earn more pay more. This contrasts with Social Security, which caps an individual’s tax exposure at $110,100. For higher-income workers (more than $200,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a couple), the Medicare payroll tax rate will increase from 1.45&nbsp;percent to 2.35 percent next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Premiums now also vary by income. While the standard Medicare premium is $99 per month this year, for beneficiaries who make $85,000 and above (based on the previous year’s tax filing), premiums are scaled so that the more you earn, the more you pay. Similarly, income-related premiums now apply to Medicare prescription-drug coverage. While public opinion may favor asking wealthier seniors to pay more, the truth is, they already do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Medicare benefits are overly generous.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current Medicare benefits package resembles what was offered when the program started nearly five decades ago. Benefits are less generous than in most private insurance plans, as demonstrated by the fact that the majority of Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental insurance — through a former employer, a private insurer or, if they are low-income, Medicaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Medicare coverage is still costly; beneficiaries pay relatively high deductibles and co-insurance. For example, the deductible for each hospital visit is $1,156. Many pay full price for medications once they hit Medicare’s limit for prescription-drug coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most glaringly, the program doesn’t cap beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket spending. In 2007, for example, Medicare paid only half of the nearly $18,000 that an average beneficiary consumed in medical and long-term care, with the remaining half divided between out-of-pocket spending and supplemental insurers’ payments. One in four Medicare beneficiaries spends 30 percent or more of his income on health expenses,according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Cutting Medicare is the only way to save it.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent legislation has proposed trimming Medicare costs by limiting increases in payments to providers and plans. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, these have rarely been found to affect quality or access to care. In fact, providers’ costs for treating Medicare patients are generally covered, and in many sectors, such as in-home nursing and hospice, providers make&nbsp;almost 20&nbsp;percent profit&nbsp;from treating Medicare patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, restraints on payments are not the most effective way to control costs; changing incentives offers much more promise. The current fee-for-service system rewards not value but volume of care (the number of doctors’ visits, medical tests, procedures, etc.). Doctors and hospitals should be paid to change the way they operate so that patient outcomes are improved and waste is reduced. Better patient engagement and stronger public health measures, such as programs to prevent obesity and its related diseases, can also lower Medicare’s cost burden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eighty percent of Medicare spending pays for treating the sickest 20 percent of patients. However,&nbsp;Obama’s health-care reform&nbsp;law, the Affordable Care Act, will set up new approaches such as patient-centered medical homes and organizations that coordinate care more efficiently by improving communication among providers, reducing duplicative services and managing prescription medications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Medicare needs fundamental restructuring.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several proposals would transform Medicare into&nbsp;a system of competing private plans, similar to the exchanges being set up under the Affordable Care Act. Under most “premium support” proposals, beneficiaries would be given a certain amount of money from the government to spend on a plan and would pay additional costs if they choose a plan that exceeds that amount, theoretically turning them into more diligent comparison shoppers. (Beneficiaries already have a choice of private HMO plans under Medicare.) While such Medicare exchanges could make sense, there is virtually no data to show that they would restrain the system’s total costs rather than simply shifting costs onto beneficiaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When politicians call for restructuring the program to save money, missing from the discussion has been the clear need for additional revenue over the longer term to support the inflow of 30 million more people between now and 2030. Even the most well-run and efficient program cannot nearly double its enrollment without a matching increase in money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Containing health-care cost growth is critical for Medicare’s survival, but it’s impossible to do that for Medicare alone. Payment restraints and incentives that improve value must be applied to the entire health-care system to be effective.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the National Coalition on Health Care released the following statement regarding the Federal District Court Decision in&nbsp;<em>Texas v. U.S.</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The highly flawed Texas court ruling threatens to increase costs for almost every American at the individual level, as&nbsp;no cost&nbsp;preventive benefits, lifetime limits and out-of-pocket limits would disappear. For taxpayers and all those who pay premiums, tools to bring more generic drugs to market, to pay smarter for hospital and other care, to require the wealthy to pay more to keep Medicare solvent, and to demand that information be shared and used to improve care and value for patients would all disappear.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the per capita&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-publication-files/SHSS-Spending-Brief_December_2018.pdf"">cost</a>&nbsp;growth rates of Medicare and Medicaid have been below their historic averages. The ACA gives Medicare and Medicaid program leaders, regardless of their political party, new tools to improve the value and affordability of health care for all Americans. These tools include new payment methods, adding new preventive benefits to coverage, closing the Medicare drug benefit “donut hole”, and testing innovative approaches to organizing and paying for services, such as a new diabetes prevention benefit being made available to Medicare beneficiaries. As an organization, we are committed to improving the affordability of coverage for every actor in the health care space,&nbsp; consumers, patients, and all purchasers of health care, including employers, Medicare, Medicaid, and other public and private programs and plans. The ACA does just that.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The National Coalition on Health Care is committed to working with the 116<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Congress to build on the ACA’s foundation for affordability and sustainability, and secure its benefits and protections for all Americans.</em></p>

<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 would reduce funding for Medicare and Medicaid by about $434 billion over the next seven years. These spending reductions would be achieved through expanded enrollment in managed care, increased premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, reduced coverage, and reduced payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers. However, some portion of the reductions in provider payments under these programs is likely to be passed on to privately-insured persons in the form of higher charges through cost shifting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this study we estimate the potential effects of this cost shifting on private insurance premiums and costs for employers and families. We also estimated the number of persons who would lose coverage under the bill due to reductions in eligibility under the Medicaid program or increases in private plan premiums. In addition, we estimate the increase in charity care expenses due to increases in the uninsured population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We begin by summarizing the Medicare and Medicaid spending reductions and reviewing the evidence on cost shifting. We also estimate the cost shift under these budget cuts and the impact that this would have on employers and families. In addition, we estimate the change in insurance coverage likely to result from this increase in insurance premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Medicare Spending Reductions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Reconciliation Act would reduce Medicare program funding by $270 billion over the next seven years. The act establishes the ""MedicarePlus"" program which would permit Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in a broader variety of private health plans. The act would also increase beneficiary Part-B premium payments and would improve fraud detection and coordination of benefits for persons with employer-based coverage. The plan also specifies specific cuts in provider payments and creates a ""fail-safe"" mechanism which would further reduce provider payments if budget spending targets under the bill are exceeded in future years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Medicare would save $57.3 billion due to the Part-B premium increase and another $9.1 billion through fraud detection and coordination of benefits provisions. Another $26.7 billion would be saved through increased enrollment in private plans. The reductions in provider payments for services (including ""fail-safe"" amounts) would be $105.3 billion for hospitals, $27.0 billion for long-term care and $44.5 billion for physicians and other providers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Medicaid Spending Reductions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The act reduces federal Medicaid funding by about $163.4 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. The bill converts the Medicaid program to a block grant program to states. The amount of each states grant would be based upon spending levels prior to implementing these reforms and would be indexed based upon an overall budget ceiling calibrated to produce $163.4 billion in federal budget savings over the 1996 through 2002 period. States must match the federal contribution based on state matching rates under the current program in order to receive the maximum federal grant</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We assume that states will put into the program only what is required to obtain the maximum federal match under the federal grant program. This implies an additional reduction in state Medicaid spending of $123.3 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. We assume that states will reduce provider payment rates so that per-capita growth in costs under the program is reduced from its current growth rate of 7.0 percent to 5.0 percent. If further funding reductions are necessary, they would take the form of reduced eligibility under the program. Under these assumptions, Medicaid enrollment is reduced by 8.5 million persons by 2002.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Evidence on Cost Shifting</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost shifting is the process whereby providers recover uncompensated care costs and payment shortfalls for public program enrollees through higher charges to private payers. For example, hospital payment rates under public programs are on average about 10 percent below costs. Hospitals also incur about $12.3 billion in uncompensated care expenses for uninsured and underinsured persons.<sup><a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#one"">1</a></sup>&nbsp;<a>These</a>&nbsp;shortfalls are recovered at least in part by increasing charges to private payers as much as 30 percent above actual costs for persons covered under private plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some studies suggest that hospitals shift as much as half of these payment shortfalls to private payers while others show less evidence of cost shifting. Our own analyses indicate that in recent years about 40 percent of the increase in hospital payment shortfalls in each year is passed on to consumers in the form of higher mark-ups on care provided to privately-insured persons. In addition, a recent study of physician pricing by Thomas Rice,&nbsp;<em>et al</em>. indicates that each one percent reduction in public payer rates is associated with a 0.2 percent increase in physician charges to private payers.<sup><a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#two"">2</a></sup>&nbsp;<a>It</a>&nbsp;is clear from these studies, however, that providers are able to shift only a portion of payment shortfalls to private payers in part because selective contracting by health plans has made it more difficult for providers to shift costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based upon a review of the literature, we assumed that 40 percent of the increase in hospital payment shortfalls under these budget cuts would be passed on to private payers in the form of higher charges. However, we assume that the percent of payment shortfalls that are shifted declines in future years to reflect continued growth in selective contracting. We also estimated cost shifting for physician payment shortfalls based upon the Rice analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the assumptions used in this analysis, payments to providers would be reduced by about $218.9 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. Uncompensated care expenses for those who become uninsured would also increase by about $65.5 billion over this period. The total increase in provider payment shortfalls would be about $284.4 billion. We estimate that in response to this, providers would shift about $84.7 billion (29.7 percent) of the $284.4 billion in payment shortfalls to private payers&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure1"">(Figure ES-1)</a>. About 52.7 percent of the increase in cost shifting would be attributed to the Medicare cuts while 47.3 percent would be attributed to Medicaid cuts.<a><strong>FIGURE ES- 1</strong></a><strong><br>ESTIMATED COST SHIFT UNDER MEDICARE<br>AND MEDICAID BUDGET CUTS</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The increase in provider charges to private payers resulting from the cost shift ($84.7 billion) would be reflected in higher private insurance premiums. Employer health spending would increase by $69.3 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period, while employee contributions for employer health coverage would increase by $5.9 billion. Expenditures for individually purchased non-group insurance would increase by $10.2 billion over this period due to the cost shift. As a result of this cost shift, by 2002, private insurance costs would be about $21.4 billion (four percent) higher than under current trends&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure2"">(Figure ES- 2)</a>.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 2</a><br>CHANGE IN PRIVATE INSURANCE COSTS RESULTING FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BUDGET CUTS UNDER THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Impact on Workers and Families</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Empirical evidence indicates that employers are likely to pass on much of the increase in employer costs to employees in the form of reduced wages. Based upon a review of the literature, we estimate that about $61.0 billion of the $69.3 billion increase in employer costs due to cost shifting would be passed on to workers in the form of lost wage growth. This wage loss is in addition to the $5.9 billion increase in employee premium contributions resulting from higher private insurance premiums. Overall, the amount of the cost shift passed through to workers would be $66.9 billion including lost wage growth ($61.0 billion) and higher employee premium contributions ($5.9 billion). Lost wages and increased premium contributions -- commonly called the pass-through -- would equal about $925 per covered worker over the 1996 through 2002 period&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure3"">(Figure ES- 3)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cost shift would affect costs for both public and private employee health benefits plans. About 18 percent of the cost shift pass-through to workers would fall on government employees (i.e., state, local and federal government employees) while about 82 percent would fall on covered workers in private health plans&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure3"">(Figure ES- 3)</a>. The amount of the pass-through per worker would tend to be highest among industries with the most comprehensive health plans such as manufacturing and transportation.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 3</a><br>DISTRIBUTION OF COST SHIFT PASS-THROUGH TO COVERED WORKERS BY INDUSTRY (1996 THROUGH 2002)</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pass-through of the cost shift will have a disproportionate impact on insured workers in lower wage groups. The lost wage increases resulting from these budget cuts would on average equal about 2.5 percent of the wage increase that workers would have received in the absence of these budget cuts over the 1996 through 2002 period&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure4"">(Figure ES- 4)</a>. However, the wage growth lost due to cost shifting would vary from about 9.3 percent for covered workers earning $6.00 or less per hour to only 1.6 percent for persons earning $25 or more per hour. This reflects the fact that health benefits represent a much greater share of total compensation expenses for lower-wage covered workers than for higher-wage covered workers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cost shifting resulting from the proposed Medicare and Medicaid cuts would be distributed across families in all income brackets. Much of the increase in family expenditures would be concentrated among middle and upper income households where private insurance coverage is most prevalent. About 60 percent of the pass-through would fall on families with annual incomes between $20,000 and $75,000. About 10 percent would fall on families with incomes below $20,000 while 30 percent would fall on families with incomes in excess of $75,000 per year.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 4</a><br>PERCENT OF WAGE INCREASE FOR COVERED WORKERS OFFSET BY COST SHIFT FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID CUTS: 1996 THROUGH 2002&nbsp;<sup>a/</sup></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We estimate that the number of uninsured persons in the U.S. under current policy will increase from 39.7 million persons in 1995 to 45.9 million persons by 2002. At the same time, Medicaid coverage is expected to increase from 36.8 million persons in 1995 to 45.9 million in 2002. With the reductions in funding under the reconciliation act, it is unlikely that states will be able to fund this increase in enrollment. In addition, private insurance costs will increase due to increased cost shifting under the act. Thus, the number of uninsured is likely to increase under the act due to reductions in Medicaid eligibility and higher private insurance costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the reconciliation act, the number of uninsured in 2002 would increase from 45.9 million to 53.7 million&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/PotentialCostShifting/#figure5"">(Figure ES- 5)</a>. This is an increase in the number of uninsured persons of 7.8 million persons in that year. This includes: about 7.2 million persons who lose Medicaid coverage under the bill who have no other coverage; and about 647,000 persons who lose employer coverage due to premium increases resulting from the cost shift.<strong><a>FIGURE ES- 5</a><br>NUMBER OF UNINSURED WITH AND WITHOUT THE RECONCILIATION BILL (IN MILLIONS)</strong><img src=""https://nchc.org/images/figurees-5.gif"" alt=""Line Graph - Figure 5"" width=""409"" height=""216""></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Summary and Caveats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ultimately, families will pay for the cost shift. Private insurers pass the burden of higher prices on to their customers in the form of higher premiums. Employers then pass on much of these increased premium costs to workers in the form of reduced wage growth and increased employee contributions. We estimate that the proposed Medicare and Medicaid budget cuts are expected to increase real health expenditures for workers by $66.9 billion over the 1996 through 2002 period. The cost shift could be substantially different than we have estimated here depending upon the effectiveness of managed care and the way in which providers respond to the budget cuts.</p>

It does not describe the effects of increased public- program shortfalls on the availability and quality of care for program beneficiaries and the uninsured. It also does not describe the impact of cost shifting on health care providers beyond the loss of revenues. Moreover, this study examined only the impact of those provisions of recent budgetary legislation affecting Medicare and Medicaid. The study does not examine the impact of various other budgetary changes affecting families such as tax reductions or cutbacks in public assistance benefits.</p>

1445,"Policy Solutions to Address the Rising Cost of Insulin","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that affects over&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-1/?loc=db-slabnav"">1.25 million</a>&nbsp;Americans. &nbsp;Also known as Type 1 diabetes, it occurs when the body stops producing the blood-glucose regulating hormone&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-1-diabetes/what-insulin"">insulin</a>; thus, juvenile diabetics must receive consistent insulin therapy to survive.&nbsp; Although insulin was&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news_landing_page/first-use-of-insulin-in-treatment-of-diabetes-88-years-ago-today"">discovered</a>&nbsp;in the 1920s, prices for the drug are astronomical by today’s standards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a juvenile diabetic, my health and longevity depend on a consistent and affordable supply of insulin. Federal lawmakers must address the rising cost of insulin, for chronically-ill individuals are unable to afford their life-sustaining medications. Oftentimes, individuals&nbsp;<a href=""https://khn.org/news/americans-ready-to-crack-down-on-drug-prices-that-force-some-to-skip-doses/"">ration</a>&nbsp;needed medications like insulin because of high costs, risking serious health consequences and even death. Individuals should not be forced to forego or sacrifice needed medication because of associated costs. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The price of insulin has soared and show no signs of stopping. The price of insulin has doubled since 2012. Eli Lilly, the manufacture of Humalog,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/health/insulin-price-humalog-generic.html"">announced</a>&nbsp;it will produce and sell a generic, half-price version of the original drug; yet, the generic will still cost $137.35 and be unaffordable for many patients. In fact, there are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.goodrx.com/insulins"">currently no generic biosimilars</a>&nbsp;for insulin on the market. Lack of competition from generics is one of the biggest reasons manufacturers continue to raise the price of insulin. How much longer do we have to wait to provide relief to patients and families who are burdened by high costs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, NCHC’s CEO and President, John Rother, published a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-the-prescription-drug-affordability-market/"">blog post</a>&nbsp;highlighting the variety of drug-pricing “sins”.&nbsp; His solutions represent viable options in the battle to lower insulin prices, and are similar to the bipartisan&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/diabetescaucus.house.gov/files/Congressional%20Diabetes%20Caucus%20Insulin%20Inquiry%20Whitepaper%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf"">recommendations</a>&nbsp;made by the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO) and Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At NCHC, we see three policies that could significantly lower the price of insulin: improve transparency, limit compounded price increases, and accelerate generic drug approvals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Improve transparency and pass discounts to patients</strong>: The supply chain through which drugs travel from manufacturers to pharmacy counters is complex and opaque. It encourages ever-higher prices as consolidation and rebate systems limit supply and hide the true prices paid. Manufacturers should be required to disclose more information about effectiveness, and all entities in the supply chain should report prices paid, discounts, and rebates received. Discounts and rebates should be shared with patients. Additionally, transparency would help patients understand their disease and the therapeutic effects of different insulin types, and make more informed choices. On the state-level,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/drug-pricing-transparency-legislation"">policies have emerged</a>&nbsp;that encourage transparency in the insulin marketplace.&nbsp; Congress should enable state-level initiatives or establish federal standards and disclosure requirements across the supply chain.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Limit compound price increases</strong>: Drug companies can and do hike prices at any time, even multiple times per year. Reforms should be enacted to hinder price increases that are not the result of higher input costs or improved effectiveness. If prices of existing therapies like insulin increase at unjustified rates, Medicare should be permitted to enter direct long-term contracts, using a tool such as arbitration, to limit price increases. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Promote generic drug development and curb patent abuses</strong>: Despite almost 100 years since the development of the first insulin, manufacturers today are granted monopolies of twelve years protecting their proprietary insulin formulas. This is too long, and Congress should revisit this length of exclusivity. Additional hurdles face manufacturers of generic insulin, including litigation from brand patent owners, and state laws that limit pharmacist substitution of generic biologics. The generic marketplace for insulin is in its infancy in the U.S., and while the FDA has begun to approve biosimilars, Congress should give the FDA more authority and funding to allow generic approval of older, off-patent versions of insulin, as well as demanding that insulin makers meet a high bar of improved effectiveness to win additional exclusivity for new formulations. Stronger solutions, such as the&nbsp;<a href=""https://doggett.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/doggett-brown-announce-bicameral-medicare-drug-price-negotiation-bill"">Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act</a>, would enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. If the manufacturer and Medicare cannot agree, Medicare would have the ability to rescind the company’s patent and issue it to a generic brand.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More aggressive action must be taken to promote generic drug development, particularly for biosimilars such as insulin. Without federal intervention and oversight, pharmaceutical companies will continue to increase the costs of pertinent drugs, fueling health care inflation and endangering patient access and health. Juvenile diabetics, along with approximately 7.5 million additional insulin-dependent people with diabetes, will continue to be at high risk of harm.</p>

<p>High health costs are one of the biggest financial challenges facing families, businesses and federal and state governments today. In recent years, rising health care costs have wiped out&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1630.abstract"">a decade of middle-class income gains</a>&nbsp;and have made employer investments in hiring and business expansion more difficult.&nbsp;Over the next eight years, health care spending is poised to grow to nearly $15,000 for each man, woman and child in the United States – a 50% jump from today’s $10,000 in per capita health care expenditures.</p>

1454,"Strengthening Primary Care","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As American health care transitions toward value-based models of care and payment, successful employers, plans, and health systems are finding strong primary care to be absolutely essential. Yet the United States spends only 4-8% of health care dollars on primary care, compared to an average of approximately 12% among other industrialized countries – each of which spends substantially less per capita on health care than the United States. To build an American health care system that delivers better care at a lower cost, primary care must become a national health policy priority. Here’s how:</p>

<p>August 11, 2011</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Shelley Jazowski</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With pharmaceutical companies hitting the “patent cliff,” the floodgates of generic competition are opened. An influx of generics into the market means patients can experience the same medical and health outcomes, but at a more affordable price. Although brand-name medicines and their generic counterparts are comprised of the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), they are held to different regulatory standards. A recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/high-court-highlights-a-gap-in-drug-safety-regulation/2011/06/24/AGSehJuH_story.html"">Supreme Court decision</a>&nbsp;(cases: Pilva v. Mensing, Actavis v. Mensing and Actavis v. Demahy)highlighted the discrepancy between brand-name and generic drug safety. In a 5-4 ruling, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-23/generic-drug-makers-shielded-from-lawsuits-top-court-says-1-.html"">Court stated</a>&nbsp;that if generic manufacturers updated their labels in accordance with state “failure to warn” laws, they would be in violation of federal law, which requires generics producers to mimic the packaging inserts used by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers. Simply put, this case highlights a conflict between state and federal law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under state statutes, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to warn consumers about&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-protects-generic-drug-makers-from-being-sued-for-lack-of-warning/2011/06/23/AGPfB1hH_story.html"">new dangerous side effects</a>. Lack of “failure to warn” lays the foundation for many, if not all, product liability lawsuits, in which the plaintiff claims that drug manufacturers are aware of the potential dangers of their product but do not provide adequate information about such dangers. Conversely, federal regulations require generic drugs to carry the exact same label information as the brand-name medicines they imitate. Under this scenario, generic manufacturers cannot update their labels with up to date safety information. Justice Clarence Thomas summed it up best, “State law imposed a duty on the manufacturers to take a certain action, and federal law barred them from taking that action.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Supreme Court ruling follows the standard of preemption, where federal law takes precedent over state law, but also brings to light the controversial issue of pharmaceutical safety, specifically highlighting a drug labeling double standard. On the one hand, the decision protects generic producers from being sued for not providing information warning consumers about side effects. On the other hand, brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers are held to a higher standard of product labeling, and thus accountable for continually updating these labels with safety information and adverse events. In essence, were the Justices proponents for a drug safety double standard?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no denying the fact that generic medicines are as, and if not more, safe and effective as brand name pharmaceuticals. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the low cost alternatives, or generics, are as effective in lowering cholesterol as the blockbuster drug Lipitor. Moreover, in the area of diabetes, generics have proven to be safer than brand name drugs like Avandia, which was issued a black box warning due to the increased risk of cardiac arrest. Affordability coupled with efficacy has propelled a surge of generic sales. It is for these reasons that the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/ims/Global/Content/Insights/IMS%20Institute%20for%20Healthcare%20Informatics/IHII_UseOfMed_report1_.pdf"">generic market share</a>&nbsp;reached 78 percent in 2010, which was a four percent increase compared to 2009.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With generics accounting for a disproportionate share of the pharmaceutical market, policymakers should address the current double standard in pharmaceutical product labeling. If generics are comprised of the same ingredients and clinical studies suggest equivalent quality, then why are manufacturers not accountable for abiding with state “failure to warn” laws? Although federal lawmakers have proposed legislation to increase access to generics, as well as introduced policies set on eradicating anticompetitive practices within the industry, they have yet to address the product labeling issue. There is no time like the present to address the discrepancy between state and federal laws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To gain entry to market, generics must demonstrate bioequivalence, so if in all respects these drugs are “equal” to their brand name counterparts, shouldn’t the laws regulating safety and labeling also be equivalent?</p>

<p>CONVERGING FORCES COULD ADD 6 MILLION TO NUMBER OF UNINSURED</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The confluence of powerful economic forces, fueled by the terrorist attacks, have unleashed a ""perfect storm"" that could increase dramatically the number of uninsured in the U.S. - with as many as 6 million more people losing their health care coverage over the two-year period of 2001 and 2002.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A report by the National Coalition on Health Care, A Perfect Storm: The Confluence of Forces Affecting Health Care Coverage, identifies those forces that could cause significant erosion in job-based coverage, mainly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· The rapid increase over the last two years in health insurance premiums, which could cause employers to drop health insurance for their employees or pay a smaller share of the premiums and pass on more of the costs to their employees. In turn, employees may not be able to pay the additional out-of-pocket costs and will have to drop health insurance even if it is offered. These problems will be particularly severe for small firms that will be most affected by the economic downturn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· The accelerated rise in unemployment resulting from the economic downturn and exacerbated by the terrorist activities, can result in more people going without health insurance because they are unemployed and cannot obtain or afford individual insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health insurance premiums for employers are rising an average of 11 percent in 2001. For small businesses, those increases are rising 12.5 percent and higher. Premium increases are far outpacing overall inflation (3.3 percent in 2001). While nearly 39 million people were uninsured for the entire year in 2000, the number could climb to 45 million in 2002, unless our society takes substantial actions to stem the incoming tidal wave of the uninsured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""During the mid-1990s we had the most vibrant economy in recent history, and still almost 5 million people were added to the ranks of the uninsured during that time,"" said Henry E. Simmons, M.D., president of the National Coalition. ""Now, with the economic downturn and the events of September 11, we are experiencing greater unemployment and health insurance premiums in 2002 are expected to outpace general inflation by the greatest margin in our history. Never have we seen such forces converge on our society and never before have they posed such a threat to the middle class,"" he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""The rapidly rising number of people without health insurance will compound already serious cost and quality problems in the health care system. Without universal coverage, you cannot assure quality, and in the absence of improved quality data, you cannot contain costs. Thus, you have a vicious cycle and a health care system that is seriously broken,"" Simmons said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition is the nation's largest, most broadly representative alliance working to improve America's health care system. The non-profit, non-partisan Coalition is comprised of over 80 member groups, including large and small businesses, unions, consumer, provider and religious groups.</p>

<p><strong>How Americans Perceive the Health Care System</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A nationally projectable poll of 1,011 American households conducted December 18-22, 1996, reveals a disturbing lack of confidence among the majority of Americans with the state and direction of health care and concern about health care quality, cost and coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The telephone poll, conducted by International Communications Research, was commissioned by The National Coalition on Health Care. The survey findings from a representative cross section of American households have a range of variation of no greater than plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their responses to a series of statements show that most people have little confidence in the ability of the system to care for people. The vast majority of Americans (79%) agree with the statement&nbsp;<em>""there is something seriously wrong with our health care system,""</em>&nbsp;87% agree that&nbsp;<em>""the quality of medical care for the average person needs to be improved,""</em>&nbsp;and only 15% have&nbsp;<em>""complete confidence""</em>&nbsp;in hospital care. Less than half of people (44%) say they have&nbsp;<em>""confidence in the health care system to take care of me.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eight in ten Americans believe that the quality of medical care is being compromised in the interest of profit. They feel that&nbsp;<em>""quality medical care has become unaffordable for the average American""</em>&nbsp;(79% agree), that&nbsp;<em>""hospitals have cut corners to save money""</em>&nbsp;(74% agree), that ""quality care is often compromised by health insurance companies to save money"" (80% agree), and that&nbsp;<em>""quality of medical care has gone down while costs have increased""</em>&nbsp;(64% agree). These views are held by people in fee-for-service plans as well as those in managed care plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a hunger to be better informed: 83% say they&nbsp;<em>""would like to be better informed about how to evaluate quality of medical care from doctors and hospitals,""</em>&nbsp;and 72%&nbsp;<em>""would like more information so [they] would feel more confident about decisions about medical care.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People are frightened by stories they've heard of medical care&nbsp;<em>""mistakes made that have hurt or even killed people""</em>&nbsp;(75%).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than half the respondents (57%) agree that&nbsp;<em>""hospital care is not very good""</em>&nbsp;and they risk being&nbsp;<em>""made sicker or more injured by mistakes made by poorly trained or overworked staff.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the majority feel confident that they could get quality medical care for themselves, they also believe there are serious problems with the quality of health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrary to the widely publicized view that government should stay out of health care, the vast majority of Americans feel that&nbsp;<em>""the federal government can play an important role in making health care better""</em>&nbsp;(69%) and ""more affordable"" (72%). These beliefs were shared by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The poll reveals a divided population regarding peace of mind and satisfaction of health care. About two-fifths of Americans are strongly alienated from the health care system. Many of those with annual household incomes of $25,000 or less are highly troubled by their experiences with cost, coverage and treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though they consider their current health care satisfactory, a large proportion of middle class respondents are also strongly troubled by what they see as serious flaws in the system related to quality, costs and access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four of every ten people polled have had reductions in coverage and are&nbsp;<em>""worried that they may lose their health insurance""</em>&nbsp;and feel they&nbsp;<em>""cannot afford medical insurance.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a positive note, four in every ten people ""strongly agree"" that their&nbsp;<em>""medical plan makes good health care affordable""</em>&nbsp;and over one-third (36%) ""strongly agree"" that they are&nbsp;<em>""satisfied with the quality of [their] health care.""</em>&nbsp;Over one-quarter (28%) ""strongly agree"" that they&nbsp;<em>""like the way their medical plan works""</em>&nbsp;and that&nbsp;<em>""[their] medical plan provides the best quality care they could want.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general, people over sixty-five years of age, and therefore covered by Medicare, are more satisfied with quality and coverage than are those in their thirties and forties. Not surprisingly, higher income families ($50,000 annual income) express more confidence and satisfaction with their health care than do those from households with middle or lower incomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four in ten Americans report having had a ""bad"" experience with treatment or care, don't have confidence in the system to take good care of them, or believe hospitals have cut corners to save money, thus endangering patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Focus group interviews recently completed in five cities prior to the survey amplify the findings of the polls. They reveal a depth of anger, fear and betrayal combined with a sense of frustration and pessimism for the future of health care. The prevailing view expressed in these interviews was that improvements in the health care system were being held hostage by partisan politics. Respondents in the focus groups displayed great cynicism about the motives and goals of the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The respondents showed impatience with the lack of progress in controlling costs, improving quality and access. Many of those who felt they were adequately protected by their insurance expressed concern and dismay at the plight of many people who they felt were unprotected and poorly cared for. Many had friends, neighbors and close relatives who lost their health insurance and were struggling to pay for or receive good health care. Their anxieties were underscored by the belief that even though they were currently protected, they could soon join the ranks without access to quality medical care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Detailed Findings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forty statements were read to survey respondents, one at a time, and after reading each statement to the respondents the interviewer asked whether they agreed or disagreed with what was said. Next the respondents were asked whether they agreed or disagreed ""strongly"" or ""somewhat."" In this way the survey was able to measure a comprehensive set of perceptions and beliefs about health care and determine how strongly held these perceptions and beliefs were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A. Perceptions of Quality</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen statements dealt directly with perceptions of quality of health care.&nbsp;<strong>The responses to many of these statements reveal very high levels of dissatisfaction with and concern about health care quality.</strong>&nbsp;The statement that generated the most agreement was&nbsp;<em>""the quality of medical care for the average person needs to be improved.""</em>&nbsp;59% of the survey participants agreed ""strongly"" with this view and an additional 28% agreed ""somewhat.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Health care was broadly criticized by eight in every ten respondents who agreed with the statement&nbsp;<em>""there is something seriously wrong with our health care system.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A more direct indictment of the quality of care was made by 75% who agreed that ""there are serious problems with the quality of health care.""</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B. Perceptions of Cost</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine statements concerned the cost of medical care, health insurance and the relationship between cost and quality. It should be noted that to most people the term ""health insurance companies"" is virtually synonymous with managed care as well as traditional indemnity plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>People perceive costs rising, coverage decreasing and quality going down at the same time. This equation adds up to anger, fear and cynicism.</strong>&nbsp;Nearly six in every ten people ""strongly"" agreed that&nbsp;<em>""quality health care is almost unaffordable for the average person""</em>&nbsp;and an additional 22% ""somewhat"" agreed. To the statement&nbsp;<em>""health insurance premiums have gone up and coverage has gone down,""</em>&nbsp;44% ""strongly"" agreed and 27% ""somewhat"" agreed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The cynicism of people is evident in their responses. They feel they are paying more and getting less while providers are profiting.</strong>&nbsp;This view is reflected in the agreement with the statement that the&nbsp;<em>""high cost of medical care is due in part to greed of the insurance companies""</em>&nbsp;(43% ""strongly"" agree, 26% ""somewhat"" agree). Only 10% agreed strongly that&nbsp;<em>""health insurance companies put the needs of customers ahead of profits""</em>&nbsp;while 43% ""strongly"" disagreed with this favorable view of their insurers. Nearly two-thirds of people agree (36% ""strongly"") that&nbsp;<em>""medical care costs have gone up but quality of care has gone down.""</em><strong>Table 2</strong></p>

An equal proportion of people say that&nbsp;<em>""my medical plan makes good health care affordable""</em>&nbsp;(38% ""strongly"" agree, 33% ""somewhat"" agree). Over one quarter of respondents feel that they cannot afford medical insurance (28% ""strongly"" agree and 12% ""somewhat"" agree).</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The survey responses reflect a lack of trust and confidence in the health care system. A system which people depend on seems to have turned into a big profit-generating business that cares little for the needs and feelings of the individual. A woman from California who participated in a recent focus group summed up this feeling by saying&nbsp;<em>""there's not much care left in health care these days.""</em></strong><strong>Table 3</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A desire to be better informed is driven in part by a lack of trust.</strong>&nbsp;Over half the respondents (55%) agreed strongly that they&nbsp;<em>""would like to be better informed about how to evaluate quality of medical care from doctors and hospitals.""</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D. Coverage</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The population is divided between those who feel they have good health care coverage and are not worried about losing it and those who feel unprotected and vulnerable to losing their insurance.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About one-quarter of the respondents strongly agreed that they worried about losing their coverage. A similar proportion agreed that their coverage&nbsp;<em>""keeps changing and getting less.""</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E. Perceived Role of Government</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Contrary to much of the rhetoric that surrounded the health care reform debate, the public sees an important role for government. Most people feel that the federal government, state and local government, and Congress can help make health care more affordable and raise the standards of quality.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When asked if&nbsp;<em>""the federal government can play an important role in making health care more affordable,""</em>&nbsp;50% agreed strongly and 22% agreed somewhat. When the role for federal government was described as&nbsp;<em>""making health care better,""</em>&nbsp;43% agreed strongly. In answer to the question&nbsp;<em>""government should stay out of health care altogether,""</em>&nbsp;28% were in ""strong"" agreement, 12% ""somewhat"", and 29% were in ""strong"" disagreement.<strong>Table 5</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When given a list of possible roles for federal government in health care, assuming government would be involved in some way, the vast majority of people said ""yes"" to setting quality standards (86%), making sure everyone has access to quality medical care regardless of their ability to pay (84%), and stepping in when organizations do not meet standards (84%).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerns raised by those polled were system-wide, relating to quality of care delivered, cost of health care and accessibility of care for the average American. While those surveyed had confidence in their personal health care delivery, there was a notable lack of confidence in the health care system at large. These anxieties crossed gender, political, age, economic and regional boundaries. Additionally, there is a widely held perception that the future of health care does not look goodóthere is little confidence that the quality of health care delivery can be improved or that health care will be available to the average American.

<p>Leading organizations from hospital, health professional, patient advocacy, religious health plan, and employer communities have joined with doctors’ groups to urge action on bipartisan SGR reform by April 1, 2014 in order to align incentives for physicians with higher value care and reward excellence. In a letter released today by the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), stakeholders urged Congressional leaders to bring the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act (S. 2000/H.R. 4015) to the floor of the House and Senate, along with vital health care “extenders” provisions and appropriate offsets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“By ending the threat of SGR-driven cuts and shifting away from volume-driven medicine, this bipartisan bill offers a real path to better care at lower cost. This is a historic opportunity to improve Medicare, and we should not ignore it,” said John Rother, NCHC’s President and CEO.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As medical societies, businesses, health care providers,&nbsp;faith-based organizations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, children, minorities, and persons with disabilities, we urge you to bring the&nbsp;<em>SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014</em>&nbsp;(S. 2000/H.R. 4015) to the floor for a vote before March 31, along with vital health care “extenders” and appropriate offsets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since its creation, the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula’s poorly conceived approach to containing Medicare costs has repeatedly threatened to disrupt access to care for seniors and disabled Americans. At the same time, underlying volume-driven payment incentives have continued to inflate Medicare premiums, increase the burden on taxpayers, and contribute to health care cost growth systemwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between now and March 31<sup>st</sup>, when the current stopgap SGR fix expires, you have the opportunity to make historic improvements to Medicare and help ensure all Americans’ health care dollars are spent more wisely. As introduced, the&nbsp;<em>SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act</em>&nbsp;would</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>end the disruptive threat SGR posesto beneficiary access and provider practice sustainability;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>establish a new 5% incentive for health professionals participating in cost-saving alternative payment models like accountable care organizations or medical homes;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>reform the existing Medicare fee schedule for physicians and other health professionals with new support for care coordination, evidence-based care and a new streamlined, value-based incentive program, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>provide new funding for quality measures and promote transparency regarding the cost and quality of health care services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recognize that enactment of these important reforms will require resolving two crucial outstanding issues: crafting long-term solutions to health care extenders and offsetting the budgetary cost of the legislation without merely shifting costs to beneficiaries, providers or the private sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, solutions exist to meet each of these challenges. From the Senate Finance Committee’s markup of SGR reform legislation last year, we know that long-term solutions to expiring extenders provisions can win bipartisan support. Work by the National Coalition on Health Care&nbsp; and others has shown that it is also possible to identify offsets which help, not hinder, progress toward a higher value health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, only your support and engagement can ensure that Congress actually pursues these solutions. The alternative, another 9-, 12-, or 21 month “doc fix,” would do little to reduce uncertainty for providers and beneficiaries and do nothing to curb long-term growth in health costs. Having advanced so far towards permanent reform, failure to act now could dim the prospects for such legislation later this year and for years to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, we urge you to work together to enact permanent SGR repeal, payment reform and extenders legislation now. We stand ready to work with you to achieve that goal.</p>

1496,"Pathways to Value-Driven Care: Progress on Hospital Value Based Purchasing","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite slowing rates in health care expenditures in recent years, health care services delivered during a hospital admission remain the largest proportion of health care dollars spent in the US. Hospital care accounts for roughly 31 percent of all health care expenditures in the US, roughly $775 billion. The current push for hospital reimbursement policy reform is focused on the perceived value of care and on the quality of patient outcomes rather than the quantity of patients served. Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, CMS released a rule Act that calls for reimbursement and incentive payments to be based on value, known as the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program (HVBPP).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Affordable Care Act of 2010 legislation mentions the word “value” close to 214 times. The definition of “value,” in relation to health care delivery, is typically described as the quality level attained at the end of prescribed care for a given cost, or quality divided by cost. Current payment reform strategists use this definition as the basis for understanding how improved patient outcomes can be achieved per dollar spent on the delivery of health care. The current goal of reimbursement reform is to reduce health care associated costs and refocus health care initiatives on quality and value. Under the HVBPP, hospitals will be incentivized with payments that are rooted in hospital outcomes based on twelve clinical processes and nine patient experience measures. This measure is expected to save Medicare $214 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program helps to reorganize the focus of health care delivery. A backward mapping approach to this policy involves key stakeholders in the implementation discussion. This approach also involves thorough explanations of initiatives, encourages feedback on the incentive payment measures used, and allocates resources to institutions in order to improve. Focusing on a “delivery-level” method for HVBP policy such as relating the problem behavior back to the closest point of contact, the patient’s perceived value of care, could also help with implementation. This reinforces the assertion that the stakeholders, not the policymakers are the individuals that possess the competence to help solve the volume and quality driven health care issue. This policy is pivotal and deserves more attention because it has the potential to change societal views on health care delivery. A commitment to “value-based” health care can also re-energize health care providers’ focus on quality-driven initiatives that allow for improved patient outcomes.</p>

Fisher, MD, MPH</strong><br>Director of Population Health<br>The Dartmouth Institute of Health Policy and Clinical PracticeAmerica’s health system faces a crisis of value.&nbsp; In an effort to stimulate dialogue and offer opportunities to learn about emerging and resurgent ideas for addressing this crisis, the National Coalition on Health Care is launching its NCHC Forums, an ongoing&nbsp; program of monthly educational briefings that will showcase a rich variety of speakers and topics.Our&nbsp; inaugural Forum will feature Dr. Elliott Fisher of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://nationalcoalitionofhealthcare.cmail2.com/t/r/l/dtjikit/eutklvtl/b/""><strong>Dartmouth Institute of Health Policy and Clinical Practice</strong></a>.&nbsp; Dr. Fisher and his colleagues at the Dartmouth Institute have been important intellectual leaders in the national effort to understand the complex challenge of health spending, producing influential analyses of variation in health care costs and advancing innovative solutions like Accountable Care Organizations and shared decision-making.In their January 2012 JAMA article, “Withholds to Slow Medicare Spending:&nbsp; A Better Deal than Cuts,” Drs. Fisher, Skinner and Weinstein offer a new approach that seeks to accelerate delivery reform, achieve scoreable savings&nbsp; and avoid across-the-board cuts in provider reimbursement.&nbsp; As policymakers struggle in the coming months to find sustainable solutions to Medicare’s provider payment and overall health spending challenges, Dartmouth’s ideas could move to the forefront of the health policy agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

In an effort to stimulate dialogue around solutions to these challenges, the National Coalition on Health Care has launched its NCHC Forums series to showcase the perspectives of health care innovators and thought leaders.NCHC’s May Forum features two private sector leaders who have demonstrated that it is possible to drive down health care costs while improving outcomes.Mr. Leyden will discuss the powerful partnerships that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has forged with hospitals, physicians’ groups, and individual providers throughout his state.&nbsp;Value Partnerships’ nationally recognized efforts to reduce medical errors, promote the highest-quality evidence-supported care, and implement the patient-centered medical home model have yielded real cost savings by focusing on improving quality and outcomes.Mr. Boress will discuss employer efforts to confront the rising cost of diabetes, particularly MBGH’s innovative Take Control of Your Health program, which provides employees diagnosed with diabetes with personalized health coaching from specially trained clinical pharmacists. This program, furnished to regional employers in partnership with the Illinois Pharmacists Association, has helped employees&nbsp; better manage their own health and improve their employers’ bottom line.As policymakers work to keep federal health care programs on a sustainable footing, private sector initiatives like these can help point the way toward a health system we can all afford.&nbsp;<strong>We look forward to seeing you&nbsp;</strong><strong>on May 15</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong>.</strong><em>NCHC Forums bring together thought leaders, policymakers and stakeholders for timely public discussions about the future of America's health system.

But if Congress does manage to end the annual “doc fix” ritual, the work of reforming health care reimbursement and benefits is only just beginning.&nbsp;Recently announced goals, like&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2015pres/01/20150126a.html"">driving 50% of traditional Medicare reimbursement through alternative payment models</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.hcttf.org/releases/2015/1/28/major-health-care-players-unite-to-accelerate-transformation-of-us-health-care-system"">basing 75% of private-sector payment arrangements on value</a>, seem miles off.To help map out a route toward achieving these goals, NCHC has brought together panelists with two specific qualifications. First, the private-sector physician groups, health plans and employers have each achieved real-world savings and care improvement, through new models of provider reimbursement and benefit design. Second, they each have ideas about what policymakers can do to bring those successes to scale—after the SGR.</li>

Dr. Gifford is the Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs at the American Health Care Association and Ms. Tobin is the Managing Director of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at Brookings Institution.The lack of comparable data across Medicare's post-acute care settings complicates coordination of care and measurement of quality and outcomes. The IMPACT Act would lay the foundation for comparing quality across settings, improving discharge planning, and modernizing post-acute care payments by requiring post-acute providers to report standardized assessment data and quality measures. Dr. Gifford and Ms. Tobin will discuss ongoing efforts to measure and improve quality and the impact this simple legislation could have on future costs and quality of Medicare post-acute care.</li>

But our health system too often fails to get patients the right medicine at the right time.

And the results have been better patient care at lower cost.&nbsp;</li>

Hartford Foundation;&nbsp;<em>living with stage IV breast cancer</em><strong>Diane Meier, MD,&nbsp;</strong>Director, Center to Advance Palliative Care,&nbsp;Mt. Sinai Medical Center<strong>Sean Morrison, MD,&nbsp;</strong>Director,&nbsp;Lilian and Benjamin Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute, and&nbsp;Director, National Palliative Care Research Center,&nbsp;Mt. Sinai Medical Center<strong>SUMMARY</strong>Palliative care provides an extra layer of support for people of any age and at any stage of a serious disease such as cancer, and can be provided alongside curative treatment. Palliative care relies on interdisciplinary teams of providers to coordinate and deliver care- centered on the patients’ needs and preferences. It focuses on treating the disease while also ensuring the best possible quality of life for the patient. Research demonstrates that palliative care can improve outcomes and improve patient satisfaction, but too often patients are not offered the choice to pursue palliative care.&nbsp;This forum will address the barriers to broader access to palliative care and explore what health care stakeholders and policymakers can do to address them.</li>

Almost half of the added sugar in the American diet is found in sugary beverages like soda, sports drinks, energy drinks (36%) and fruit drinks (11%). Reducing the consumption of sugary beverages, which typically do not satiate hunger or provide nutritional benefits, may lead to substantial gains in the health of the nation.In an effort to achieve that goal, one policy option now under consideration is changing the relative price of sugary beverages through taxation.&nbsp;This forum will review the health consequences of sugary beverage consumption, explore tax policy as a mechanism for health behavior change and discuss the economic and public health benefits that could stem from a tax on sugary beverages.</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Budget Hawks, Health Care Advocates Come Together Around Smart Health Care Savings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC –<a href=""http://momentoftruthproject.org/"">The Moment of Truth Project</a>, the budget group co-chaired by Erskine Bowles and former Senator Alan Simpson, and the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), a coalition of health care stakeholders, released a joint paper outlining possible policy options designed to achieve real Medicare savings through better care at a briefing on Capitol Hill today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This paper demonstrates that good health policy and good budgetary policy can be one in the same,” said Ed Lorenzen, Executive Director of The Moment of Truth Project. “These bipartisan reforms could both achieve savings in the Medicare program and help advance quality and efficiency improvements across our health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s briefing featured a presentation from Lorenzen and NCHC President and CEO John Rother as well as a a panel discussion with Keith Fontenot of the Brookings Institution and Katharine Hays of the Bipartisan Policy Center.&nbsp; The event was moderated by Washington Post health care reporter Sarah Kliff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Rother, “For all the disagreements elsewhere in health policy, our analysis found that consensus has formed around three bipartisan approaches that curb costs while improving care… pay providers for value over volume, promote care coordination and inject competition into our health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building on previous work on delivery and payment reform from both organizations as well as a number of other recent budget and health care proposals, the paper examines several proposed reforms to health care delivery and payment in detail and explores options to ensure those reforms can produce scoreable budgetary savings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Engaging Health Care Consumers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With health care&nbsp;reform, there is an increased focus on the important role of consumer engagement in improving population health outcomes. Purchasers are focused on providing consumers with resources and tools that enhance clinical quality through the consideration of medical appropriateness to mitigate variations. Trends include the addition of services like Expert Remote Second Opinion and Treatment Decision Support. Behavioral economics approaches such as financial incentives tied to health coverage have been introduced to engage individuals in these programs.</p>

1517,"HEALTH CENTERS, PHYSICIANS URGE CONGRESS TO AVOID THE 2017 PRIMARY CARE CLIFF","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC - At a Capitol Hill forum yesterday, The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), and three leading primary care physician societies urged Congress to avoid an approaching funding cliff for health centers and workforce programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Chronic disease is extremely costly. Primary care is the affordable solution—one that works to improve outcomes while reducing costs,” stated NCHC President &amp; CEO John Rother. “For lawmakers looking for a bipartisan approach to health care, strong, sustained support for primary care would be a great start.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday’s event, entitled<strong>&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;Care:&nbsp;High-Value Care for Underserved Communities,&nbsp;</strong>was the second of three forums on critical primary care challenges, co-hosted by NCHC, NACHC, The American Osteopathic Association (AOA), The American College of Physicians (ACP) and The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and workforce programs in underserved rural and urban communities, such as the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education, were highlighted for their vital roles and in a set of recommendations endorsed by NCHC and its co-hosting organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Community health centers and programs like the National Service Corps are bipartisan health care success stories. But for us to succeed, Congress must not take us over the primary care cliff,” says one of the event’s panelists Brenda Johnson, CEO of La Clinica Health Care, a community health center in Medford, OR.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Event panelists included Ms. Johnson; Dr. Kemi Alli, Chief Executive and Medical Officer of Henry J.

1518,"NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE URGES A FRESH START ON HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement&nbsp;by NCHC President and CEO John Rother regarding the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“We need health care that is more affordable for all, but according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the current House plan moves us in the opposite direction. &nbsp;It is time for a fresh start.”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care, a nonpartisan alliance of over 90 patient, payer,&nbsp; purchaser and provider organizations&nbsp;representing more than 150 million Americans, urges Congress to reject the current House budget reconciliation proposal and pursue a different approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to CBO’s independent analysis, the House plan would have the following real-world results:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>21 million fewer Americans with health care insurance in 2020 and 24 million fewer in 2026</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A 60% lower tax credit for eligible individuals purchasing non-group coverage in 2020</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>An $880 billion cut in federal support for state Medicaid programs over the next ten years- effectively shifting these costs to states, their taxpayers, providers and beneficiaries</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also know from an&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/imo/media/doc/CMS%20Medicare%20solvency%20letter%20Final%20Signed.pdf"">earlier Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary analysis&nbsp;</a>that the House plan’s&nbsp;repeal of the 0.9% increase in the Medicare payroll tax for certain high-income taxpayers&nbsp;would mean three fewer years until the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund’s projected insolvency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These outcomes would impose very high costs on American families and block ongoing reform initiatives that move us toward a more affordable system. &nbsp;We are particularly concerned that $880 billion in cuts due to reduced federal support for Medicaid expansion states, changes to Medicaid’s financing structure and cuts to home- and community-based services would imperil many positive delivery reforms that hold promise for a better performing, lower cost health system. Changes of this magnitude are also likely to disrupt the ability of physician practices, hospitals, nursing homes, community health centers, and mental health and substance abuse treatment providers to remain open and furnish needed care for patients with all types of insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC advocates a fresh approach to fixing what’s broken in American health care. After taking reasonable steps to stabilize the non-group market (the proposed State and Patient Stability Fund represents one worthwhile idea),&nbsp;Congress should focus&nbsp;on addressing the underlying causes of high health care costs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>waste and unnecessary care,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the high costs of&nbsp;prescription drugs,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the lack of coordinated care for high-cost patients,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Inadequate support for&nbsp;primary care, resulting in avoidable specialty care, hospital stays and institutionalization,</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>lack of investment in population health.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These five factors drive high costs without adding value, and are a more constructive focus for efforts to move our health system toward better performance and more affordable costs for everyone. NCHC is ready to work with the Congress and the Administration on an economically sustainable and politically achievable plan.”</p>

1519,"ROTHER CALLS AHCA FAILURE POSITIVE FOR HEALTHCARE","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The failure of the House of Representatives to pass its ACA repeal and replace&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;is positive for healthcare and for the health and&nbsp;financial security of all Americans.We hope Congress will now abandon efforts to&nbsp;advance any bill&nbsp;that shifts hundreds of billions in&nbsp;federal&nbsp;Medicaid costs onto states and beneficiaries or&nbsp;leaves tens of millions fewer Americans with coverage – as&nbsp;this one would have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is, however, still much that must and can be done to address costs that are far too high both for the federal budget and for individuals. The National Coalition on Health Care, which is made up of more than 90 major organizations representing providers, payers, and patients, believes that bipartisan progress toward improving the value of our health system is still possible.&nbsp;In particular, we urge&nbsp;Congress and the Administration&nbsp;to address the unsustainable&nbsp;high costs of prescription drugs, the need to better coordinate care for our sickest patients – those with multiple chronic conditions, and the importance of strengthening programs for disease prevention and population health.&nbsp;The stakes are too high to further delay constructive&nbsp;measures that can make healthcare more affordable.”</p>

1521,"CONGRESS NEEDS A DIFFERENT APPROACH ON HEALTH CARE","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although we lack a full&nbsp;Congressional Budget Office(CBO) analysis, the House budget reconciliation package appears to fall short with respect to NCHC’s central priority, improving health care affordability. We&nbsp;are also &nbsp;concerned the bill would shift costs now born by the federal government onto consumers and state taxpayers. It is time for this Congress to begin considering a different approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a series of blog posts on NCHC’s website in the summer of 2016, we expressed our hope that certain concepts in the House Republican Conference’s health care blueprint,&nbsp;<em>A Better Way,</em>&nbsp;could serve as the basis for serious discussion and common ground. We singled out that document’s support for&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-in-a-better-way-to-fix-health-care/"">value-based insurance design</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-part-2/"">pre-existing condition protections, and state innovation funds</a>&nbsp;as constructive. Yet we also took&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/examining-selected-proposals-in-a-better-way-part-3/"">strong exception</a>&nbsp;to policies that merely moved costs borne by the federal government onto consumers or taxpayers at the state level.</p>

<p>With the release and accelerated markup of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), we have now seen the 115<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Congress’ first effort to translate&nbsp;<em>A Better Way</em>&nbsp;into legislation. Regrettably, preliminary analyses from outside research organizations, ranging from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1811131&amp;SctArtId=418648&amp;from=CM&amp;nsl_code=LIME&amp;sourceObjectId=10006958&amp;sourceRevId=3&amp;fee_ind=N&amp;exp_date=20270307-22:26:18"">Standard &amp; Poors</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-affordable-care-act-repeal-and-replace-plans-might-shift-health-insurance-tax-credits/"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, indicate that the AHCA would have significant negative effects on affordability and coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We continue to consult with our member organizations regarding the legislation. Once a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis is released, we expect to react to its central provisions, including its Medicaid and tax credit sections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even without a publicly available CBO score, serious problems are apparent. These flaws undercut its authors’ own stated goals of minimizing disruption to Americans’ current coverage during a transition period and empowering states to lower costs and improve care. Indeed, aspects of the bill could do serious and immediate harm- even before the broader Medicaid per capita allotment and tax credit provisions take effect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our early analysis has identified specific provisions that would:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Threaten the stability of non-group insurance markets:&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ways and Means Budget Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations immediately zero out the penalty for failing to meet current law’s individual responsibility requirement. Yet the proposed State Patient and Stability Fund, established to stabilize the market, is scheduled to go into effect in 2018. That deadline may prove challenging to meet operationally. And any mismatch between the individual responsibility requirement repeal and the availability of state stabilization funds could destabilize non-group insurance markets. This effect will only be exacerbated by continuing uncertainty around the availability of cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments for 2018 and 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decimate chronic disease prevention efforts: Section 101 of the Energy and Commerce Budget&nbsp; Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations immediately eliminates the Public Health and Prevention Fund without making any provision to replace those dollars through Congressionally-directed spending. A funding cut of this magnitude not only eliminates 12% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget; it threatens $625 million a year in support for innovative state and local initiatives to fight preventable chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undermine Medicare Financing:&nbsp; As called for in the W&amp;M Recommendations, the immediate repeal of the 0.9% Medicare Hospital Insurance payroll tax is estimated to accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund forward to 2025-absent offsetting revenues. This manufactured crisis could be used by a future Congress as a pretext to impose blunt provider, health plan or beneficiary cuts in Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defund state Medicaid expansion coverage for the working poor:&nbsp; Section 112 of the E&amp;C Recommendations would maintain enhanced federal support (E-FMAP) for Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled as of Jan 31, 2019. However, if a beneficiary has any break in Medicaid coverage of a month or more, the enhanced E-FMAP would be terminated. This encourages states to drop from coverage any childless adult who secures a job paying more than the Federal Poverty Level (just $1005 per month for a single individual in 2017). In itself, this is a work disincentive. Additionally, Section 116 incentivizes state officials to audit their circumstances and earnings to ensure that they are eligible. The interaction of these provisions would immediately begin reducing Medicaid expansion and significantly limit states’ flexibility to support employment and cover the working poor through Medicaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is time for Congress to consider an entirely different tack. Congressional leaders should set aside sweeping overhauls of the health sector and return to a more step-by-step approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For our part, the National Coalition on Health Care has come together around several nonpartisan policy objectives, which could inform the development of a constructive agenda:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stabilize the non-group health insurance markets, by maintaining cost-sharing reductions and tax credits, avoiding disruption of current Medicaid funding and providing ongoing risk stabilization support</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bring down the cost of care in Medicare and the private sector by improving chronic illness care, further accelerating the transition away from fee-for-service, and embracing value-based insurance design</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Expand primary care, prevention and other interventions that improve outcomes and reduce downstream medical costs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Extend the state-based Children’s Health Insurance Program(CHIP) and bolster funding for the nation’s network of community health centers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Tackle the high cost of prescription drugs through market-based solutions: transparency, value, and competition</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is much that is broken in American health care. To have hope of fixing these problems, this Congress and Administration will have to act. Unfortunately, we fear that the legislative language advanced this week could make Americans’ health care affordability problems worse, not better.</p>

1523,"MEMBER SPOTLIGHT: PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For NCHC’s first Member Spotlight, we are thrilled to feature&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/"">Pacific Business Group on Health</a>&nbsp;(PBGH). PBGH represents the interests of dozens of private and public purchasers working towards the same goal—an improved and innovative healthcare system that benefits the American public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founded as an organization for purchasers, its members include some of the largest national and regional companies in the U.S. By drawing on its members’ own experience testing healthcare innovations, PBGH is able to identify what’s working and help other purchasers bring those models to scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One noteworthy effort has been PBGH’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/iocp"">Intensive Outpatient Care Program (IOCP)</a>, designed to better coordinate care for medically complex and chronically ill patients and, in turn, cut costs and unnecessarily duplicated services. Funded by a three-year Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) grant, IOCP is now operating across five states (CA, WA, AZ, NV, and ID) in partnership with 23 physician groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preliminary data from&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/5/1317.full"">earlier tests of this model</a>&nbsp;with a commercially insured population show a reduction in costs of up to 20%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IOCP is just one of the many&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/programs"">innovative healthcare initiatives</a>&nbsp;led by PBGH.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We applaud PBGH’s unwavering efforts to work towards affordability and efficiency and are pleased to work with them in this ever-changing healthcare environment.

<p><em>by John Rother</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rising cost of healthcare is one of the greatest economic, fiscal, and moral challenges facing the United States, not just for the next four years, but also for coming generations. Successful efforts to simultaneously improve quality and outcomes while “bending the curve” of healthcare spending must be a top national priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where We Stand Today</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite substantial progress reforming the health insurance market and reshaping healthcare delivery in the past six years, current trends are not promising for America’s older adults, or the population as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undoubtedly, the United States has benefitted from an unexpected slowdown in health spending growth and the fact that more than 90 percent of the population is currently insured. But that fortuitous slowdown has largely ended, with spending climbing again at a rate well above inflation and wage growth, albeit not as high as historical norms. The reality is that the cost of Medicare and Medicaid will consume increasing shares of our economy and our federal budget in the years and decades ahead. Any resurgence of healthcare spending growth will only accelerate the impact of an aging population on health spending. And as Medicare costs grow, so will the premiums paid by beneficiaries, a development which will negatively affect their ability to afford care—with the greatest immediate impact on the 5 percent of beneficiaries, who generate 50 percent of healthcare spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the non-Medicare population, the situation is no better. Recent analyses of the employer market and the non-group market show rising premiums and rapidly climbing deductibles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this trajectory, future generations of Americans will find it increasingly difficult to afford the care they need. Faced with these affordability barriers, Americans will experience higher rates of illness, disability, and early&nbsp;mortality than they otherwise might. Unless we act, this combination of poor health and the increasing cost of care will gradually erode our standard of living—until the security provided today by programs like Medicare, and the American dream of generational progress, both vanish under the growing burden of healthcare costs.</p>

1531,"CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS OF REPEAL AND TRANSITION","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Senate’s decision to take up&nbsp;the Fiscal Year 2017 budget resolution, Congressional leaders are now pursuing repeal of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act without an immediate replacement. It is time that we took a hard look at this strategy’s implications for health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the outset, I should stipulate that this course of action is not one NCHC can support. Despite real flaws in the ACA and pressing affordability challenges, the United States&nbsp;has&nbsp;managed to end pre-existing condition denials and benefit caps, cover more Americans and slow the growth in Medicare spending. In our view, this Congress ought to be working together, on a bipartisan basis, to fix what’s broken in our health system without first putting these broadly supported achievements at risk…now or in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, this post is not a polemic against repeal. Instead, I want to invite ACA supporters and opponents alike to examine a very specific aspect of forthcoming repeal legislation….the replacement fund, established by Section 3002 of the budget resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This “fund” may seem like an arcane detail in the budget process, but exactly how Congress handles this issue will substantially impact the lives of ordinary Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You see, ending the ACA’s major coverage provisions such as the affordability tax credits, the Medicaid expansion or the individual and employer mandates, will produce savings to the federal treasury. Although much of these savings are expected to offset the rollback or delay of taxes which helped pay&nbsp;for the ACA, the budget resolution provides that all but $2 billion of the&nbsp;<em>net</em>&nbsp;savings from any repeal bill would be set aside in this fund to cover the cost of eventual replacement legislation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s say the eventual repeal bill sunsets key coverage provisions after two years and allocates the savings to this replacement fund. &nbsp;How much would go into this fund?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HR 3762, the vetoed repeal bill from 2015 which today’s Congressional leaders are using as a template, produced $317.5 billion in net savings, or $516 billion when accounting for macroeconomic effects,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/costestimate/hr3762followingenactmentofconsolidatedappropsactof2016.pdf"">according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office</a>. (We will not know the exact impact of this year’s legislation until CBO scores an actual bill specifying the provisions to be repealed and the date of their repeal, but using the HR 3762 numbers should give us a rough approximation of what this year’s repeal effort&nbsp;might generate.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem is that $300-500 billion is only a fraction of the $1.4 trillion in direct ACA coverage spending which is expected to be repealed. Even if our lawmakers were given the judgment and wisdom of Solomon, it would not be possible to cover the same number of people at one third of the cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No efficiencies, newly wrung from the health system, can be sufficient to make up a budgetary difference of that magnitude. Lawmakers will be forced to turn to some combination of the following blunt force cuts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reducing the size of the tax credit available for private coverage or limiting the number of people eligible for that tax credit under any replacement</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cutting Medicare benefits or payments to providers and plans</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Capping the exclusion of employer sponsored health plans from income and payroll taxes</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reducing the overall level of federal support for state Medicaid programs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Theoretically, lawmakers could look outside health care to fund ACA replacement legislation. Unfortunately, domestic discretionary spending, now at historic lows, could not provide much. Large scale defense or social security savings, even if advisable, would be politically unlikely, and tax reform advocates would fight to devote any revenue to the lowering of rates, not new health care spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Congress moves forward with repeal and transition, it seems likely that individual market customers and plans, Medicare beneficiaries and their providers, Medicaid programs in all 50 states and DC, and employers offering health coverage would be pitted directly against one another. What one gains, someone else will lose. For everyone with a stake in health care, it would amount to a war of all against all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your view of the ACA, why would any of us want to live through the scenario described above? Instead, let’s begin the hard work of identifying ways to confront the increasing unaffordability of coverage and care in this country.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON – In a letter submitted Tuesday evening, the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation’s largest and most broadly representative alliance of health care stakeholders, called on Congress to preserve the Department of Health and Human Services’ flexibility to test alternative models of provider payment in Medicare and Medicaid and expand those that are successful.</p>

<h3><strong>Why We Matter</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An affordable, high-quality health system is critical to the health of our population and the health of our economy. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA)&nbsp;expanded access to health care to more than 32 million Americans and included important strategies for lowering health care costs and improving quality, health care costs and total spending continue to soar for government, businesses, and families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current upward trends in health care costs and spending are not sustainable. Our members agree that the Coalition’s overarching goal of affordable care for all can be met by addressing the systemic, interrelated challenges of cost reduction and quality improvement in both the public and private sectors. We embrace the reality that these challenges can only be met through shared responsibility and effective collaborations between all of the key stakeholders in the health system. We recognize that many recent proposals to curb health spending would merely shift health care costs from the federal budget to public and private sector health budgets, without meeting the urgent need for meaningful systemic change; in fact, they could even delay progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>Our Work</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition played a constructive and important role in the overall effort to achieve health care reform and to strengthen measures designed to “bend the curve” of cost growth across the board. Today, the Coalition works to advance change across the health system through a multi-pronged program of policy development, consensus building and advocacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition’s public education activities are designed to increase understanding of the impact of health cost and quality problems on our nation’s physical and financial health. We have initiated a series of monthly forums on research and innovations relevant to the key challenges facing America’s health system. These are open events, allowing experts on health topics to actively engage with key stakeholders, Congressional staff and reporters on health system change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition is a respected nonpartisan educational resource for Congressional members and staff. The Coalition regularly comments on pending legislative proposals and offers Congressional staff its expertise in the development of policies to improve value and reduce costs.</p>

1537,"BROAD STAKEHOLDER COALITION PRESSES LAWMAKERS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CHRONIC CARE BILL","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“By bringing down barriers to better care for the chronically ill in both Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, this draft bill promises to spur delivery and benefit innovation across the health care system. The National Coalition on Health Care calls on the Finance Committee, and then Congress as a whole, to move forward expeditiously with meaningful&nbsp;chronic care legislation.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Better chronic care is fundamental to ensuring health care affordability in the United States.&nbsp;NCHC and its members have long advocated for a strong legislative response, beginning with chronic care in Medicare. We commend the leadership and dedication of the Finance Committee, Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, Senator Warner and Senator Isakson, and their staffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Of course, the details of all these policies will be crucial; NCHC and its members will continue to work with Congress to ensure the strongest possible bill.&nbsp;<strong>But Senators Hatch, Wyden, Isakson, and Warner have given their fellow lawmakers a remarkable opportunity: to demonstrate that bipartisan commitment can produce constructive solutions to health care affordability challenges. Congress should take that opportunity…and with the cost of care steadily climbing, they should take it soon</strong>.”</p>

<p>As Election Day 2016 approaches, it is time to take a look at the candidate’s health care proposals.&nbsp; Although this issue has not played an especially prominent role recently in either Hillary Clinton’s or Donald Trump’s campaigns–although it was briefly discussed the October 9 debate–it is certainly an issue of importance to many Americans, and will continue to be so well after the election is over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Commonwealth Fund recently released a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/other/2016/sep/2016-candidates-health-proposals"">report</a>&nbsp;comparing the two candidate’s health care proposals and not surprisingly, there are stark differences between their two approaches.&nbsp; In short, Clinton wants to keep the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but make needed changes; her proposals would&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the number of people with health insurance by 400,000 to 9.6 million.&nbsp; Trump would repeal and replace the ACA with a proposal entitled “Healthcare Reform to Make America Great&nbsp;Again;” it would&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;the number of people with health insurance by 15.6 million to 25.1 million.&nbsp; Both Clinton’s and Trump’s proposals have an impact on the deficit of course; the Commonwealth Fund has estimated that the impact of Clinton’s proposals could range from a $0.7 billion reduction in the deficit to a $90 billion increase.&nbsp; They estimate that the Trump proposals would increase the deficit by $0.5 billion to $41 billion.</p>

1541,"EXAMINING SELECTED PROPOSALS IN ‘A BETTER WAY TO FIX HEALTH CARE’: COVERAGE POLICY AND HEALTH CARE INNOVATION (PART 2)","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our blog post on July 14, we talked about some of the provisions in the House Republican Health Care Task Force’s health reform proposal — entitled “A Better Way” — that NCHC believes would modernize and improve the Medicare program for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. In later posts, we will turn a critical eye toward their plans for the children, seniors, and low-income adults who depend on Medicaid and CHIP.&nbsp; But today, we identify some elements of the Task Force’s coverage and innovation proposals that represent good starting points for future dialogue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an organization, NCHC has long been committed to finding common ground solutions to our health care challenges. And&nbsp; “A Better Way” does provide some room for future conversation. The Task Force report opens with the following quote: “Americans deserve an accessible and affordable health care system that promotes quality care and peace of mind. It should empower patients and support innovation.”&nbsp; We could not agree more with these goals.&nbsp; After all, the National Coalition on Health Care was established to support efforts for better and more affordable coverage for all Americans, and we too believe our health care system should focus on patient-centered, high quality health care.</p>

<p>On June 22, the House Health Care Reform Task Force, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan, released their blueprint describing how the House Republican caucus’ hopes to reform our country’s health care system, entitled “A Better Way to Fix Health Care.” There is much in their approach that we at NCHC do not support.&nbsp; To name just a few examples, there is nothing particularly appealing about proposals to roll back federal support for Medicaid and CHIP, raise Medicare’s eligibility age or shutdown the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s crucial work on alternative payment models.&nbsp; We’ll have more to say on these issues in later blog posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are ideas in the package that, properly developed, could improve our health care system. So we begin today by taking a close look at a few constructive proposals included in the report’s Medicare section.</p>

<p>""ADDRESS QUALITY ISSUE IN HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>by:<br>Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P.<br>President and Founder of the<br>NATIONAL COALITION ON HEALTH CARE</p>

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The health care industry accounts for a trillion dollars in yearly expenditures. It represents approximately 14 percent of GDP. No industry of comparable size exists in our economy. Yet it operates without a system-wide framework for defining, measuring and ensuring quality. In what other industry would that be tolerated by the American public?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look at the airline industry. When the TWA and ValuJet crashes occurred last year, the Government swung into action: the Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI launched year-long multi-million dollar investigations; Congressional hearings were called almost immediately; a presidential commission on airline safety, headed by the Vice President, was announced and sweeping new regulations were unveiled jut a few months later; and every sector of the airline industry came under intense scrutiny by Congress and the media. On average, plane crashes take approximately 700 American lives every year.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now look at the health care industry where an estimated 180,000 - yes, one hundred and eighty thousand - Americans die unnecessarily due to errors in medical treatment. An additional 1.3 million are injured, with one million of those injuries considered preventable. The death rate is equivalent to three jumbo-jet crashes every two days.<a href=""https://nchc.org/noharm/#link"">*</a>&nbsp;Despite the alarming prevalence of medical errors in the health care system, no federal investigations are launched, Congress pays little or no attention, and the public is generally unaware.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ""dirty little secret"" of the world's best health care system is that the industry is operating in a quality control vacuum with no universally accepted guidelines for procedures or practices. Our health care system could be better, safer and less expensive, if we devote just a fraction of the attention to quality in health care as we do to safety in the airline industry. And the results would be more far-reaching.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The basic quality problems are: overuse, when a health service is provided in circumstances where its risks outweigh its benefits, thereby incurring unnecessary costs and more harm than benefit to the patient; underuse, the failure to provide a service that provides a benefit and saves money in the long run; and misuse, when a beneficial service is provided poorly, resulting in a preventable complication. Unfortunately, as the industry stands today, there are no commonly accepted parameters for determining which procedures provide the greatest benefit at the lowest cost. There are no universally accepted cost/benefit analyses for specific drugs to treat specific diseases. And there are no systematic methods of changing medical behaviors which may be the result of ignorance of the latest treatments and technologies, as opposed to the carelessness or incompetence.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the absence of quality assurance measures, we have moved steadily toward a system that rewards lower cost and does not adequately concern itself with quality. Ironically, a system that puts a premium on lower costs, can actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run because of ineffective and inappropriate initial treatments. As a means of controlling costs, attention has focused on ""inputs"" rather than on ""outcomes"" -- the price of the treatments, rather than on the value of the results. Clearly, if quality guidelines are to be set, the outcomes side of the equation is the one that needs to be researched and analyzed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quality assurance studies throughout the health care industry would identify what works and what doesn't; and better yet, what works and works better. Tried and true methods would constantly be re-examined against new and improved ideas. Such an enlightened industry would know that low cost alone does not always equate with value or excellence, or even efficiency.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Addressing the quality issue in an aggressive and comprehensive manner must be our highest priority in health care. Recently, President Clinton announced his Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. What better body to begin the process whereby we, as a nation, create system-wide quality guidelines and accountability, and at the same time provide better, more equitable and affordable health care? If the commission does its job, and if consumers and providers act upon it recommendations, we just might be on our way to ""first, doing no harm.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a>*</a>&nbsp;Lucian L.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>April 23, 2012</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expect the health care reform law to result in more than $200 billion in savings through 2016 because of measures that include ending excessive payments to private insurers that offer Medicare Advantage plans and implementing new anti-fraud policies. The estimate came from a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/apps/files/ACA-savings-report-2012.pdf"">report</a>&nbsp;released by the CMS' Office of the Actuary. The report also said that health care reform lowers premiums and out of pocket costs for seniors, resulting in about 59.4 billion in savings through 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Affordable Care Act is the key to lowering healthcare costs in a way that improves care for beneficiaries, instead of cutting services,"" said CMS&nbsp;Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. ""In the short term, both taxpayers and beneficiaries will save billions thanks to the healthcare law. Over the long run, the Affordable Care Act will allow us to invest in new models of providing care that will save money and deliver higher-quality care.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>April 16, 2012</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care released new research suggesting that marketing coupons for brand-name prescription drugs are influencing the drug treatments of more than 2 million seniors, despite a prohibition on their use in Medicare. &nbsp;A previously released study by Visante showed that the use of these coupons could drive up non-federal health costs by $32 billion in the next decade. NCHC's research, released today, shows that these coupons are costing Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers as well. With the evidence piling up, Congress and the administration should investigate the use of these coupons and their impact on spending in Medicare and across the health system.&nbsp;Addressing this issue would be a good first step to reducing the waste and unnecessary expenses driving up the health care costs.</p>

<p>We recently expressed cautious support for the CMMI Geographic Direct Provider Contracting model in a letter to CMS. New opportunities for physician groups, health plans, and other organizations to partner to serve Medicare, and Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible beneficiaries could bring new innovations in care delivery to more beneficiaries. As the number of alternative payment models grows, however, so does the complexity of attribution of outcomes and costs. In addition, the potential for confusion among beneficiaries increases as multiple organizations engage in outreach and marketing to describe their services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On March 18, from 1-2pm ET, The National Coalition on Health Care and West Health co-hosted the first of a two-part, Hill briefing series: “The Burden of High Drug Prices on Communities of Color”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3><strong>Watch the full recording here:<br><br></strong>https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQWlT-3u1xY</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first briefing highlighted how high drug prices, coverage gaps, and other systemic issues drive health inequities for communities of color. The briefing featured several prominent speakers (biographies below) and&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WH_Gallup_BurdenofHighDrugPricesInfographic_March2021-002.pdf"">updated data</a>&nbsp;from West Health’s survey on drug accessibility and affordability. The briefing also focused on how COVID-19 has underscored the substantial impact that race and income have on health outcomes, exacerbated by inaccessible drugs and systemic barriers to coverage. The session also discussed how previously proposed legislation would potentially impact communities of color and reduce health inequality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second briefing will focus on specific legislation later in the year (more details to come!).</p>

1587,"NCHC: Surprise Medical Billing Primer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surprise medical billing contributes to unpredictable, high out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Patients often encounter surprise medical bills when receiving emergency or ancillary health services from out-of-network practitioners. Recent studies indicate that surprise billing is concentrated in specific specialties like pathology.1 These providers “balance bill” patients for the difference between the full charge for services and the amount paid by the insurer, or bill for the entire amount of undiscounted charges. Payers, providers, facilities, and health consumers are all stakeholders to consider in legislation to address surprise medical bills. In protecting consumers, policymakers should not fuel health care inflation, but rather, promote reasonable solutions that appease payers, providers, and patients.

1589,"NCHC Urges a “No” Vote on “Skinny Repeal” &amp; Underlying Bill","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - On Thursday morning, NCHC sent a letter to all Senators urging&nbsp;their opposition to forthcoming “skinny repeal” proposals, related amendments, and final passage of HR 1628. See the text of the letter&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NCHC-Letter-on-skinny-bill-and-HR-1628-1.pdf"">here</a>&nbsp;and below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization composed of more than 80 leading health care consumer, purchaser, provider and payer groups-dedicated to health care affordability. NCHC’s members represent as employers, members or congregants more than 150 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Senator:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the National Coalition on Health Care, I write to communicate our strongest possible opposition to the latest health care repeal legislation, commonly referred to as the “skinny bill.” We urge you to vote “No” on this bill, related amendments, and final passage out of the Senate. At its core, this legislation is an exercise in cost-shifting that does little to address the fundamental affordability challenges confronting American health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing more than 80 participating organizations, including medical societies, businesses, unions, health care providers, faith-based associations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The Coalition is committed to advancing - through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy – an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As reported in the media, the “skinny bill” would zero out penalties under the current law’s employer and individual responsibility requirements. This approach shares the fundamental flaw of the American Health Care Act, the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, and the Better Care Reconciliation Act; it uses reductions in federal support for coverage – especially state Medicaid programs - to finance a rollback of the Affordable Care Act’s revenue provisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO’s) December 8, 2016 analysis, the majority of the reduced outlays resulting from a repeal of current law’s individual responsibility requirement are attributable not to any new efficiencies or lower costs, but to a reduction in Medicaid enrollment. Furthermore, according to a CBO cost estimate released July 26, 2017, this “skinny bill” approach would result in 15 million fewer Americans with health coverage in 2018 and 16 million fewer in 2026.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of these serious negative consequences to families, businesses, and taxpayers at the state level, the National Coalition on Health Care cannot support this bill. However, there is an urgent need for bipartisan Congressional action to stabilize existing coverage arrangements, including the non-group market and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. NCHC also favors federal action to encourage state-led health reforms and to free up providers and plans to better combat chronic disease, strengthen primary care, invest in public health, and employ market-based strategies to tame high drug prices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Persisting in efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act via reconciliation procedures only makes addressing these urgent challenges more difficult. We call on Senators of both parties to put this divisive debate behind them and begin the real work of making health care more affordable for the American people.</p>

1594,"NCHC Supports Key Provisions of CHRONIC Care Act","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Statement&nbsp;by John Rother, President &amp; CEO of National Coalition on Health Care</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“People with multiple chronic conditions account for the majority of health spending, and their care is too fragmented and costly. This legislation is a promising beginning of the effort to address the problem, but certainly not the end.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“NCHC applauds&nbsp;the Committee, its Members, and their staff for their commitment&nbsp;to this issue&nbsp;and the bipartisan process that produced it. NCHC&nbsp;supports the following&nbsp;provisions of the CHRONIC Care Act:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 201, Providing Continued Access to Medicare Advantage (MA) Special Needs Plans for Vulnerable Populations</strong>: MA Special Needs Plans have served as incubators for promising delivery and benefit innovations, enabling plans to develop new ways of managing chronic disease and coordinating care for some of the sickest Medicare enrollees. This important provision ensures that they can continue to play that role.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 301, Adapting Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees</strong>: NCHC supports the expansion of the MA VBID demonstration to all fifty states and U.S. territories. As currently implemented, this demonstration includes important beneficiary protections, including the requirement that cost-sharing is reduced rather than increased and uniform notice requirements. The national expansion of this model test can better inform the development of future reforms to align benefit structures with ongoing value-based provider-payment reforms and lower cost barriers to needed care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 302, Expanding Supplemental Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees</strong>: This important provision will ensure plans can deploy services that may not be covered under Medicare but can improve health outcomes and lower costs. Examples of such services should include, but need not be limited to, non-covered transportation, nutrition, in-home support services, behavioral health services, palliative care services, home improvement, communication devices, caregiver training and support, assistive devices, and remote patient monitoring systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Telehealth Provisions: Certain telehealth provisions of the CHRONIC Care Act are consistent with NCHC-supported telehealth legislation—the CONNECT for Health Act (S. 1060). We are pleased to support the following provisions:<br><strong>-Section 102, Expanding Access to Home Dialysis Therapy<br></strong><strong>-Section 304, Providing Accountable Care Organizations the Ability to Expand the Use of Telehealth<br>-</strong><strong>Section 305, Expanding Use of Telehealth for Individuals with Stroke</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 401, Providing Flexibility for Beneficiaries to be Part of an ACO</strong>: This provision makes needed improvements to the Medicare Shared Savings Program, including the option to assign beneficiaries to ACOs prospectively in all MSSP tracks and through beneficiary attestation. Should the voluntary attestation provision be enacted, Congress should work closely with CMS to ensure a robust coordination and outreach effort that extends beyond mere notification. Properly implemented, Section 401 represents an initial down payment on the reforms that are needed to ensure ACOs realize their potential to improve Original Medicare.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Moving forward, NCHC hopes to secure&nbsp;enactment and effective implementation of legislation&nbsp;that preserves and builds on the policy achievements reflected in the Chairman’s Mark.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By John Rother</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gilead should be commended for taking action to make their best-selling treatment for Hepatitis C, Sovaldi, available to more people around the world.&nbsp;In India, they’ve struck licensing agreements with generic firms to produce the product for pennies on the dollar.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Gilead’s largess is being funded largely on the backs of American families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years, the predictable path for pharmaceutical companies has been to maximize profits in the U.S. and then make drugs available worldwide at lower prices– either for charitable reasons or because of price controls in other countries.&nbsp;While it may be fair that Americans should pay more than those in the poorest nations, the real questions is: how much more?&nbsp;Some of the poorest Americans suffer from Hepatitis C and are covered by taxpayers through programs like Medicaid and the VA. As it stands, Gilead is taking billions from these vital programs, forcing administrators to make very hard choices about how to allocate limited resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gilead is due to receive FDA approval in the next few weeks for a new all-oral formulation of Sovaldi that most analysts predict will be priced even higher than the current version.&nbsp;This, however, is a golden opportunity for Gilead to do the unexpected–to give some price relief to Americans who have long subsidized the industry’s R&amp;D efforts through high prices.&nbsp;Even with a substantially lower price, Gilead will still stand to make billions of dollars annually from their new Hepatitis C drug formulation because an estimated 3 million Americans carry the infection.&nbsp;Ridding the population of a dangerous virus is a laudable goal and is now possible, but only if we can afford the cure.&nbsp;Gilead could perform an important act of public service and advance the health of American families if it follows the road less travelled, and does the right thing by making this important cure affordable.</p>

<p><strong>Washington, D.C. –</strong>&nbsp;The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) released a statement opposing the the Administration’s approach to address drug pricing through the two rules released Friday, November 20.</p>

<p>The rules – removing the current&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/default/files/rebate-rule-discount-and-pbm-service-fee-final-rule.pdf"">rebate safe harbor</a>&nbsp;in Medicare Part D and establishing a&nbsp;<a href=""https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/mfn-ifc-rule"">“Most Favored Nation” Model</a>&nbsp;in Part B – rightly recognize the urgency of addressing exorbitant drug prices, especially during the twin public health and economic crisis of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Coalition believes that these hasty rules will only burden future efforts by a new Congress to make necessary and sustainable changes to our drug pricing system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.4sighthealth.com/has-healthcare-lost-its-appetite-for-value/"">4Sight Health blog post</a>, David Burda writes about the waning enthusiasm among industry executives towards value-based purchasing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Burda discusses a health care executive survey by&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.definitivehc.com/value-based-care-2019-survey-results"">Definitive Healthcare</a>, showing the biggest barriers and accelerators to value-based purchasing. The survey highlighted five major barriers: lack of resources, gaps in interoperability, unpredictability in revenue, changing regulations, and challenges collecting and reporting patient data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Potential survey methodology limitations aside (it’s not clear how responses were placed into different buckets), these are formidable barriers that are unlikely to be changed soon. In terms of regulatory and policy changes, critics commonly point to the role MIPAA has played in the complexity of the value-based landscape. I would add that proposed changes to Stark and Anti-Kickback regulations are a timely example of regulatory change – both with potential promise and pitfalls. Although the intent might be to create less regulatory risk, these proposed rules might not provide enough clarity to make widespread VBP more popular or viable.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, organizations still face limited resources, which is of concern for smaller practices. An unintended consequence of pushing more VBP could be more market consolidation. Smaller and more rural providers are unlikely to have the internal resources to keep up with the growing requirements of VBP arrangements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The survey results also asked executives to comment on what is&nbsp;<em>accelerating</em>&nbsp;VBP – most executives believe the more provider compensation is tied to value, the more VBP will grow. This is intuitive but unlikely to happen by itself without external forces pushing providers to abandon simpler and more lucrative fee-for-service business practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other surveys in Burda’s post were dedicated to how many dollars are tied to value-based contracts. Premier, the North Carolina-based group purchasing organization, released&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/press-releases/premier-inc-survey-health-systems-report-that-changes-are-needed-to-accelerate-adoption-of-risk-based-payment-arrangements"">the results of its survey of executives</a>, for example. Less than 20 percent of respondents reported having more than half of their population covered by Medicare fee-for-service risk-based arrangements, with few respondents indicating that will grow substantially. (Nonetheless, Premier noted that hospitals “remain interested in pursuing risk-based contracts”, despite the lack of growth). Other surveys indicate that various types of VBP arrangements from alternative payment models and shared savings models, to ACOs and nursing facilities, all make up relatively small amount of total business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps rightfully so: progress in VBP to actually achieve savings, increase quality, and streamline health care have been mired in significantly complex regulations (because of legitimate fears of gamesmanship) and weak incentives or risk associated with participation (because the fee-for-service status quo is a challenging beast and the upside incentives are small).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, its notable that these aforementioned surveys were health care industry focused. Surveys of the health care&nbsp;<em>purchaser&nbsp;</em>community, which have an entirely different financial relationship to the status quo, may conclude that there is still enthusiasm for the VBP movement – despite the lack of progress and appetite among the health care industry – because they see little or waning&nbsp;<em>value</em>&nbsp;from premiums they pay for employees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In December, the Catalyst for Payment Reform, in partnership with the National Association of Health Care Purchasers, held a&nbsp;<a href=""https://connect.nationalalliancehealth.org/viewdocument/tracking-progress-on-payment-reform"">webinar</a>&nbsp;on the progress of VBP, which largely confirm the results mentioned by Burda. The results found that, although the percent of total dollars flowing through pay for performance stagnated, dollars flowing through shared savings increased. Still, in the years’ analyzed “no at-risk payment method accounted for more than 4% of total dollars”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it seems clear that the lack of appetite, especially for risk-based pay for performance, is likely because some providers could lose total compensation as a result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is there to do? For some, like those at the Catalyst for Payment Reform, increasing incentives and risk is the first place to go. The NAHCP hopes employers will hold health plans accountable (or look elsewhere for procuring high-value health care). The current stagnation indicates that some policy clearly needs to change, and health care leaders seem skeptical that innovation is likely without more providers and more dollars being attached to outcomes rather than volume.</p>

<p><strong>NCHC, Stakeholders Counter Attempt to Cripple Competition from Generic Biologic Drugs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, D.C. (June 5, 2012) – In a letter to U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, health care advocates, seniors groups, unions, pension funds, consumer advocates, and health plans joined with the National Coalition on Health Care to urge the FDA to reject recent efforts to limit generic competition to high-cost biologic prescription drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter was a response to comments from several pharmaceutical manufacturers submitted to the FDA that call for assigning generic biologic drugs a different International Nonproprietary Name (INN) from that belonging to the original brand name drug. The impact of this regulatory change could extend beyond FDA rules; several state prescribing laws require that generics can only be substituted for a brand name drug if they have the same name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This seemingly obscure regulatory decision could seriously impact the affordability of prescription drugs.&nbsp; In these states, consumers and health plans would continue to face costs that can exceed $100,000 a year per person for a single brand-name drug,” explains NCHC President and CEO John Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter also stressed significant negative implications for patient safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Requiring different INNs for biologics and biosimilars could lead to patient and prescriber confusion, increasing the possibility of medication errors, and would also effectively separate the biosimilar from existing safety information about the underlying molecule,” the letter states.&nbsp; “In addition, since adverse events and product recalls for small-molecule and biologic drugs are already successfully identified using the national drug code and lot number, there is no compelling evidence that biosimilars should be handled differently.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With high drug costs, driven by the high price of biologics,&nbsp; burdening consumers, businesses and public institutions alike,&nbsp; a competitive market for these drugs is vital for both our health system and the national economy,” said Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Signatories to the letter included the National Coalition on Health Care, Health Care for America Now, AARP, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), Alliance for Retired Americans, AFL-CIO, American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Medical Students Association, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, California Public Employees Retirement System, Community Catalyst, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Older Women’s League, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), United Automobile, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, United Steelworkers (USW), US Action, and US PIRG.</p>

<p><em>Please find the PDF version&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Senate-leader-letter-path-ahead-for-health-care-2.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May 8, 2017</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the National Coalition on Health Care, I write today to urge the Senate to pursue an alternative,&nbsp;<em>bipartisan</em>&nbsp;path forward on health care. The course we advocate consists of two components: first, short-term legislative action to prevent health coverage disruptions and curb costs and, second, work toward eventual bipartisan compromise on more controversial issues related to the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. They represent—as employees, members, congregants, and volunteers—more than 150 million Americans. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Path Forward for Health Care Reform</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The need for reform and for Congressional action is not in question. Today, American families grapple with substantial and escalating health care affordability challenges. The non-group market has seen substantial cost increases exacerbated by political uncertainty in Washington. But premiums in the relatively stable employer-based insurance market have also climbed 58% from 2010-2016 even as the average deductibles grew 61%.<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-senate-letter-path-ahead/#_ftn1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;Two and a half million Americans earning at or below the poverty level in non-Medicaid expansion states are denied access to both Medicaid and the affordability tax credits that could bring non-group coverage within reach.<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-senate-letter-path-ahead/#_ftn2"">[2]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the core of the House-passed American Health Care Act consists of $839 billion in Medicaid cuts that foreclose states’ option to expand Medicaid eligibility and impose a per capita cap system that shifts risk and cost, now borne by the federal government, onto state taxpayers. These Medicaid provisions are paired with a dramatic reduction in the total tax credits available to non-group market consumers. CBO’s initial estimates predicted an increase in the number of uninsured Americans of 14 million just next year and 24 million by the end of the budget window, even as the legislation increased costs for those with pre-existing conditions or nearing retirement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than struggling to fix this fundamentally flawed legislation through the budget reconciliation process, the Senate should pause and take the time necessary to craft more lasting,&nbsp;<em>bipartisan</em>&nbsp;solutions. The test of those health care reform solutions should be whether they make health coverage and care more affordable&nbsp;while continuing to expand coverage and access. This process will not be easy, but it is a process in which NCHC and health care stakeholders can engage, and one which may produce legislation worthy of support<em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Preventing Immediate Disruption to Americans’ Health Care</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As broader reform is considered, however, Congress faces pressing needs and opportunities that demand a rapid legislative response geared toward preventing disruptions to Americans’ health coverage and addressing the underlying trend in health care costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Provide a mandatory appropriation for cost-sharing reductions.&nbsp;These payments are necessary to avoid an immediate 20% spike in non-group insurance premiums,<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-senate-letter-path-ahead/#_ftn3"">[3]</a>&nbsp;to prevent further destabilization of the states’ insurance markets, and to ensure doctor visits and prescription drugs remain within reach for 7 million Americans who directly benefit from cost-sharing reductions and millions more who depend on non-group coverage. With the significant uncertainty due to the pending&nbsp;<em>House v. Price</em>&nbsp;case and the administration’s refusal to provide assurance of CSR payment past the current month, Congressional action is needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enact a long-term extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).&nbsp;Existing funding levels for CHIP expire on October 1, but with state legislatures wrapping up legislative sessions already, action is required much sooner. MACPAC estimates that absent an extension, states will begin exhausting their federal resources later in calendar year 2017, threatening coverage losses for many of the 8.9 million children who rely on this program.<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-senate-letter-path-ahead/#_ftn4"">[4]</a>&nbsp;Congress should consider pairing CHIP extension with measures to extend important Medicare policies set to expire later this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tackling Underlying Growth in Health Care Costs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preserving coverage options, though vitally necessary, remains far from sufficient. With chronic disease accounting for 86% of the United States’ health care dollars, federal policy must begin confronting the growing costs associated with chronic illness in a serious way. NCHC recommends three broad strategies to improve outcomes while lowering costs for this population, and Congress will have opportunities to pursue each of them before the end of 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curb the cost of treatment for chronic disease.&nbsp;The incentives for volume over value of health care services, characteristic of fee-for-service provider payment, have contributed to the rising cost of treating chronic disease. The value-based care movement, particularly the push toward new alternative payment models that assume responsibility for entire patient populations, offers hope of moderating this upward trend. If health care is to become more affordable, this movement must not only continue, it must accelerate. The following legislative steps are essential:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Send the strongest possible bipartisan Medicare chronic care legislation to the President’s desk, building on the recently introduced CHRONIC Care Act (S. 870);</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure timely, long-term extensions of expiring primary care infrastructure and workforce programs that are needed to support strong chronic care in underserved communities-the Federally Qualified Health Center Program, the National Health Service Corps, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consider additional legislation empowering health plans and providers to deploy upstream interventions, either directly or in partnership with community-based organizations, whenever such interventions reduce downstream medical costs and improve outcomes (e.g. well-targeted social services, housing and housing-related services, substance abuse and mental health interventions, or home- and community-based services).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tame escalating prescription drug costs.&nbsp;The fastest growing category of health care expenditures today is prescription drugs. Unsustainable pricing practices and barriers to competition, especially generic competition, are imposing affordability burdens on consumers, taxpayers, and businesses. NCHC Action Fund’s Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing has advanced an agenda of market-based solutions—transparency, competition, and value—to curb escalating drug prices. Although we strongly support the timely passage of FDA user fee legislation, we urge Congress to pair these User Fee Acts (UFAs) with constructive measures to address the skyrocketing cost of pharmaceuticals. Specifically, we recommend including provisions that would:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bar brand name manufacturers from denying samples to generic competitors through legislation such as the FAST Generics Act or CREATES Act;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reduce the backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration, and prioritize FDA approval of applications for classes of drugs with no or limited generic competition;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take steps to promote the development of a robust biosimilars market; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Focus the Orphan Drug Act’s incentives to develop medicines for true rare diseases.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reduce future demand for health care services.&nbsp;The most desirable way to curb chronic disease treatment costs is to have a healthier population with less need for services in the first place. Because this long-term goal can only be achieved through consistent effort over time, this Congress should&nbsp;take care to preserve stable overall funding levels for proven federal prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and elsewhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America’s health care problems are serious. However, if Congress takes the short-term steps described above, it can forestall unnecessary disruption to Americans’ care while beginning to address rising costs and unaffordability. In so doing, you will have built a record of success and cooperation necessary for bipartisan compromise on the coverage issues related to the Affordable Care Act. If you have any questions regarding the issues addressed here, please contact me directly at&nbsp;jrother@nchc.org&nbsp;or at 202-638-7151.</p>

<p><strong>WHY WE NEED TO FIX AMERICA'S AILING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's been six years since the nation and the media erupted in a frenzy over the state of the nation's health care system -- the rising cost of medical care, the growing number of the uninsured, and the serious problems in the quality of care. The problems have not gone away. They have, in fact, become worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite a strong economy with low inflation and the lowest level of unemployment in more than 20 years, the cost of health care continues to soar and the number of uninsured Americans -- many of them workers -- is growing at the rate of about 750,000 a year. There are now more than 42 million uninsured and millions more are underinsured. Health care spending has reached $1.3 trillion dollars a year, and are rising rapidly. These costs account for one dollar out of every eight spent in the U.S. economy today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are serious and growing problems in the quality of much of our care, with overuse, underuse and misuse of services. As a result, millions of Americans are injured and more than one hundred thousand die unnecessarily each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care is a major issue for American businesses. Those businesses that provide health insurance for their workers often pay more than they should as the cost of treating uninsured patients is shifted to the insurance-paying employers, their employees, and public in the form of higher medical costs and inflated insurance premiums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High and rising health insurance premiums have forced businesses to shift a larger share of the cost of health insurance to workers making it increasingly difficult for workers to afford employment-based coverage and a workforce with no access to preventive care lives in fear of getting sick, may be less productive, and is more likely to switch jobs in order to obtain health care benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In spite of these major problems in the health care system, policymakers have not developed legislative programs adequate enough to address these issues. Rather, they have tried incremental efforts which have not solved the uninsured problem, made health insurance more affordable, or improved the quality of care. And, despite well-intentioned efforts to pass legislation that would give consumers a patient's bill of rights or add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, these measures will do little to address the major problems in the health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following fact sheets describe the extent of three interrelated problems plaguing our health care system: cost, coverage and quality. It is critical that we all understand the magnitude of the problems in the health care system so together we can craft workable solutions.</p>

<p><em>Please see the PDF version with citations&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/17-4-24-NCHC-MA-RFI-Response.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write to offer the comments of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) in response to the Request for Information on “2017 Transformation Ideas” for the Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D programs. We greatly appreciate this opportunity to comment on these important issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, for employers and other payers, and for taxpayers. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. Our member organizations represent—as employees, members, congregants, or volunteers—more than 150 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly one in three Medicare beneficiaries exercise their option to receive their Medicare benefits through MA Plans and Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs). But in addition to providing important coverage choices, a well-functioning MA program has the potential to advance delivery, payment, and benefit reforms that will improve health care affordability overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>NCHC’s comments are aimed at helping Medicare Advantage realize that potential. To summarize, we encourage you to</em><br><em>A. Ensure MA payment accounts for the real costs of patient care,</em><br><em>B. Align MA with other ongoing efforts to support quality measurement, value, and payment innovation,</em><br><em>C. Restore Quality Incentive Payments impacted by the MA benchmark cap, and</em><br><em>D. Promote consumer engagement in plan choice and innovation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A. Ensure MA Payment Accounts for the Real Costs of Patient Care</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adjust for chronic kidney disease and dementia costs</strong><br>Beneficiary advocates and health plans alike have communicated their concerns to CMS that the current risk adjustment approach does not adequately account for care costs incurred by beneficiaries with chronic kidney disease or dementia. Yet this problem has yet to be adequately addressed. CMS should develop and move toward implementation of such adjustments as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Apply a frailty adjuster at the beneficiary level to LTSS recipients in all MA plans<br></strong>The CMS-HCC risk-adjustment model does not adjust for frailty. For that reason, CMS currently permits Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) providers and Fully-Integrated Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (FIDE-SNPs) to receive a frailty adjuster. The frailty adjuster is calculated based on these plans’ average level of frailty and is applied at the plan level, as opposed to the beneficiary level. PACE providers and FIDE-SNPs are permitted to receive the frailty adjuster because they directly furnish longterm services and supports (LTSS). All other plans, including D-SNPs and Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs), are excluded from receiving the frailty adjuster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In making this distinction about which plans are eligible for the frailty adjuster, CMS is equating frailty with use of LTSS services. Medicare spending is higher for LTSS users than it is for non-LTSS users. MedPAC and MACPAC have reported that Medicare per user spending is much higher for LTSS users - $31, 921 for institutional LTSS users, $22,438 for Home- and Community-Based Service (HCBS) state plan users, and $19, 172 for HCBS waiver users – while per user spending for non-LTSS Medicare beneficiaries was much lower ($14,089 per user).1 These additional costs are incurred not only by PACE providers and FIDE-SNPs, but also by other SNPs, MMPs, and the full range of other MA plans that enroll LTSS users. But because these other MA plans are not eligible for the frailty adjuster, Medicare payments to these plans do not account for the additional Medicare costs associated with LTSS utilization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To accurately pay plans that care for LTSS users, CMS should develop a beneficiary-level frailty adjuster for all LTSS users (both institutional and HCBS users) and apply that adjustment to LTSS users enrolled in all other MA plans. This would more appropriately pay plans for the additional Medicare costs associated with LTSS users and would provide plans additional resources to manage the LTSS population. The application of this adjuster should be implemented in a non-budget neutral manner, consistent with current policy with respect to the PACE and FIDE-SNPs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>B. Align MA Policy with Other Ongoing Payment and Quality Initiatives</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Integrate appropriate behavioral health measures into MA STAR ratings<br></strong>Behavioral health comorbidities are strongly associated with greater use of other health care services and higher costs. Yet, throughout the US health care system, there is often little of the coordination between mental health, substance abuse, and other health care providers that is needed for optimal care. Behavioral and mental health metrics can help change this, and in fact, CMS has chosen to include behavioral health measures in other CMS performance measure sets. Many of the best health plans are taking steps to improve behavioral health services across a variety of populations and enhance integration. Yet there now are not sufficient behavioral health measures in the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system to support these effective innovations or encourage their adoption elsewhere. Provided the overall measurement burden on plans is not substantially increased, integrating effective substance abuse and mental health measures into the STAR Ratings will ensure MA plans are rewarded for their efforts to improve behavioral health and make behavioral health an integral part of overall care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Count MA risk contracts toward MACRA risk thresholds in 2017<br></strong>MACRA affords a five percent bonus to those physicians that take risk in Advanced Alternative Payment Models in Original Medicare (including Innovation Center demonstrations and the Medicare Shared Savings Program). Entities must meet certain risk thresholds to qualify for bonuses. Currently, no MA arrangements count toward MACRA’s Medicare-only risk thresholds, even if physicians are taking substantially more risk from an MA plan than any Original Medicare models currently offer. CMS should amend its approach in order to count MA risk contracts between plans and physicians for MACRA purposes, beginning with the 2017 performance year. CMS has the legal authority to make incentive payments to participants in MA APMs by deploying the agency’s flexibility to test models through the Innovation Center or through the agency’s general demonstration authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Broaden use of telehealth in Medicare Advantage<br></strong>We note that CMS is waiving various restrictions on coverage of telehealth services both in certain Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) models and in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. NCHC generally supports these waivers and believes they can have a positive impact on outcomes and costs. However, in the context of Medicare Advantage, CMS has previously stated that agency is confined to the statutory parameters for telehealth services covered by Original Medicare for purposes of the basic benefit package. As efforts proceed to promote telehealth elsewhere in Medicare, we hope CMS will also pursue administrative strategies to create greater flexibility around telehealth services in Medicare Advantage and work with Congress to remove any statutory barriers that remain. CMS should also explore increasing health plans’ ability to test new, CMS-approved technologies that show promise to aid in disease management and patient engagement, such as personalized glucose monitors and blood pressure devices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue guidance on the implementation of the new Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program in Medicare Advantage<br></strong>NCHC strongly supported the recent expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Program and its ongoing implementation as a benefit under Medicare Part B. To date, CMS’ outreach has been targeted to providers in traditional Medicare. MA plans lack guidance as to whether or how the benefit will be implemented under Medicare Part C. We urge CMS to clarify these issues as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Expand the MA VBID demonstration to all 50 states and Puerto Rico<br></strong>NCHC supports expanding the MA Value Based Insurance Design (VBID) Model to all fifty states and Puerto Rico.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Change the definition of allowable supplemental benefits<br></strong>More flexibility is needed to include a wider range of supplemental benefits that support upstream interventions directed at targeted conditions or populations. When properly targeted, interventions like nutrition support, social services and transportation can reduce downstream medical costs and improve health outcomes. For example, a pilot program in Medicare Advantage spanning 36 states and 135,000 beneficiaries showed the value of helping a senior gain access to regular healthy meals after a hospital discharge, resulting in health care savings averaging 31% per member per month for the first month following discharge.2 Currently, health plans can only use their rebate dollars to provide a relatively narrow definition of health-related supplemental benefits, limiting their ability to target benefits and forge innovative partnerships with community-based organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Special Needs Plans (SNPs) should be permanently authorized and given appropriate flexibility<br></strong>Despite bipartisan support to permanently authorize SNPs and clear evidence of their efficacy, these specialized plans are set to expire on December 31, 2018. 3 CMS should work with Congress to encourage permanent authorization. CMS should also work with SNPs and beneficiary advocates to identify areas where more flexibility is needed, such as customized high value provider networks, better education and targeting to enroll appropriate candidates, and more flexibility in innovative benefit design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>C. Restore MA Quality Incentive Payments Impacted by the Affordable Care Act’s MA Benchmark Cap</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most regions of the country, Medicare Advantage plans with four or more stars under the STARs rating system are eligible for quality bonus payments. These plans enjoy an additional incentive to improve the quality of coverage and care provided to their enrolled beneficiaries. However, based on CMS’ reading of a provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring that county benchmarks not exceed the pre-ACA amount, many of the highest-performing plans are now denied the full quality bonus payments that their STARS ratings otherwise would have earned. Under any sensible national quality bonus system, the highest-rated plans in the most efficient areas of the country ought to be rewarded. Instead, based on the previous administration’s erroneous reading of the ACA, the current approach reduces or eliminates their bonus entirely. This undermines the incentive to improve and innovate in the delivery of care and benefits for beneficiaries. Other commenters have identified existing legal authorities that permit CMS to correct this problem. We urge you as Administrator to revisit this issue and pursue every possible means to correct it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>D. Promote Consumer Engagement in Plan Choice and Innovation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CMS’ Request for Information (RFI) places appropriate emphasis on “facilitating individual preferences” and ensuring that people with Medicare have “options that fit their individual health needs.” CMS should advance policies that encourage people with Medicare to make active and informed choices about the coverage options that are right for them. Additionally, as CMS moves forward with innovative new models in Part C and D like the MA VBID demonstration, a strong consumer role in the establishment, implementation, and evaluation of these models is desirable. The following recommendations are intended to facilitate the achievement of these important consumer engagement objectives:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Personalize the Annual Notice of Change (ANOC)<br></strong>Informed, enabled beneficiaries are essential to well-functioning health insurance markets. To fully evaluate plan choices, people with Medicare need access to more robust support tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ANOC is one of the most important documents for improving beneficiaries’ ability to make wise choices. CMS should take steps to personalize the MA and Part D ANOC for individual recipients so that it explains changes through the beneficiary’s frame of reference.4 We understand that individual plans are taking steps towards personalization regarding medication and pharmacy network changes. We encourage CMS to support broader adoption of these steps. Specifically, we recommend that CMS solicit input from multiple stakeholders on recommendations to improve the MA and Part D ANOC, EOC, Summary of Benefits, and other standardized materials used during the annual election period, perhaps through a more targeted Request for Information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, in the 2018 Final Rate Notice and Call Letter, CMS indicates that MA and Part D plans should continue to disseminate both the ANOC and Evidence of Coverage (EOC) by September 30th.5 We encourage CMS to revisit its prior recommendation to require separate mailings of the ANOC and EOC for MA plans to bring more beneficiary attention to the ANOC and to extend that recommendation to standalone Part D plans. The EOC is long and detailed, and many MA enrollees do not understand it or even read it fully. By contrast, the ANOC is a shorter, more streamlined tool and, more importantly, it is time sensitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Revitalize the Plan Finder<br></strong>The Medicare Plan Finder is the premier online tool available to help people with Medicare, family caregivers, and professionals evaluate and compare the MA and Part D plan options available in a given region. While this tool has significantly improved since the inception of the Part D benefit, more can and should be done to enhance the usability of the Plan Finder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We encourage the agency to establish a long-term goal to incorporate a searchable MA provider directory in Plan Finder that includes both individual practitioners and hospitals. To date, provider network information is not fully integrated in Plan Finder, significantly diminishing its utility for those seeking to compare and contrast MA plan options. Clearer information on cost-sharing and coverage for MA supplemental benefits, like dental and vision care, is also needed. Other improvements could include incorporating better comparison tools, especially related to out-of-pocket costs and comparing Medicare Advantage to Traditional Fee-For-Service (FFS) Medicare, as well as user-friendly sorting capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the interim, we urge CMS to engage in a transparent, multi-stakeholder process to solicit input on needed Plan Finder improvements and how best to redesign this important consumer tool. Now more than ten years following the establishment of Medicare Part D, we believe Plan Finder is overdue for a comprehensive update. Any such updates to Plan Finder should leverage existing consumer research work at CMS, and be implemented following comprehensive consumer testing across the array of beneficiary populations in Medicare. With 10,000 people becoming eligible for Medicare each day and MA enrollment on the rise, we encourage CMS to redesign Plan Finder to better meet the needs of a growing population of MA and Part D enrollees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Engage consumers in model development, implementation, and evaluation</strong><br>Through the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation, CMS solicited input on and then finalized two health plan innovation models, the Medicare Advantage Value-Based Insurance Design (MA V-BID) model and the Part D Enhanced Medication Therapy Management (MTM) model. As a multi stakeholder coalition, NCHC believes soliciting this kind of input from the full range of stakeholders can contribute greatly to CMS’ reform efforts. But engagement of beneficiaries and their advocates is particularly important to transformation initiatives’ sustainability and impact. As the Agency proceeds, we urge CMS to create mechanisms to ensure beneficiaries and their advocates are involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of these models. Towards this end, we recommend the following actions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convene regular meetings of a consumer and patient advisory council;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create multi-stakeholder advisory panels on specific delivery and payment models;</li>

<li>Regularly engage beneficiaries and their advocates as new models are implemented;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Publicly release all data, metrics, outcomes, and evaluation findings for each model;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enhance support for beneficiaries via 1-800-MEDICARE and State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs); and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Carry out beneficiary testing and readability reviews of patient-facing content for each model.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create the Alternative Payment Model (APM) Ombudsman<br></strong>We support CMS’ commitment to creating an Alternative Payment Model (APM) Ombudsman to monitor the beneficiary experience with existing and emerging CMMI models and to serve as a clearinghouse for patient and consumer information. We expect the APM Ombudsman will play a critical role for MA enrollees in the MA V-BID program, enhanced MTM demonstration, and any other health plan innovations the Agency might pursue.</p>

1623,"NCHC Praises Senate Chronic Care Effort, Calls for 2016 Legislative Action","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC— The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), an alliance of leading national health care, consumer, labor and business groups, submitted a comment letter today offering overall praise for chronic care reforms under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee Chronic Care Working Group and urging legislative action this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2015/07/15/hlthaff.2015.0600"">resurgent health care costs</a>&nbsp;putting pressure on the Medicare program, family budgets and employer bottom lines, stakeholders welcome this bipartisan effort to tackle our costly chronic disease epidemic,” stated NCHC President and CEO, John Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On May 22, 2015, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and Ranking Member Ron Wyden announced the creation of the Chronic Care Working Group, led by Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Senator Mark Warner (D-VA).&nbsp;Today’s NCHC comment letter responds to a December 18 document circulated by the Chronic Care Working Group to health care stakeholders, which enumerated options under consideration for possible legislation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Better chronic care now can improve the quality of life for today’s seniors and disabled Americans and help keep health care affordable in the future,” said Rother. “Neither Medicare beneficiaries nor the rest of us should have to wait until the next Congress for progress.”</p>

<p><em>NCHC Forum on Capitol Hill features Employer and Health Plan Successes</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two private sector innovators took their successful approaches for reducing health costs and improving care to Capitol Hill today in a National Coalition on Health Care Forum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event featured presentations from Tom Leyden of Blue-Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) and Larry Boress of the Midwest Business Group on Health. Leyden has spearheaded collaborative quality improvement efforts, and Boress has worked with employers to curb the financial and human costs of diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As policymakers work to keep federal health care programs on a sustainable footing, successful initiatives like these can help point the way toward a health system we can all afford,” said event moderator and NCHC President and CEO John Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leyden, Director of Value Partnerships for BCBSM, briefed an audience of staffers from congressional offices and stakeholder organizations on his organization’s nationally recognized work to reduce medical errors, promote high quality care and improve care coordination for Michigan patients. BCBSM’s initiative around patient-centered medical homes has already yielded a 22 percent reduction in costly hospital admissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Reducing health costs while increasing quality is an achievable goal with the right players and incentives.&nbsp; With the active collaboration of our physician and hospital partners across Michigan, we took on the root causes of high costs in the health care system.&nbsp; Together, we have empowered physicians to transform their practices across many levels of the health care system from primary care to hospital care.&nbsp; The work is hard, but the payout for BCBSM, our customers, our provider partners and our members is substantial,” said Leyden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boress, the President and CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health, focused his presentation on an innovative effort known as Take Control of Your Health. The Midwest Business Group on Health and the Illinois Pharmacists Association partnered to provide employees suffering from diabetes with personalized health coaching from specially trained clinical pharmacists. The results have substantially improved health for workers and lowered costs for their employers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Boress, “The key to improved health and lower cost is getting those with chronic disease to gain confidence and skills to take control and responsibility for their condition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s event is the second in an ongoing series of National Coalition on Health Care Forums on Capitol Hill designed to stimulate dialogue around key health care issues.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why should we care about the Farm Bill? Isn’t it policy that supports America’s farms and farmers? Well partially, but it also influences food policy: the availability of certain foods, prices, clean drinking water, chemical-free healthy food, food stamps, etc. It covers a wide range of issues that will, in some form, affect you and your health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This bill deals with issues that are under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), an agency that releases the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with resources such as, the Food Pyramid and the latest, MyPlate.&nbsp; The USDA recommends that fruits and vegetables make up about half of the food on our plates. However only a fraction of the Farm Bill goes to support healthy fruits and vegetables as they are categorized as “specialty crops,” and local food systems have no budget in the bill. If every American ate according to the USDA’s recommendations, there would not be enough fruits and vegetables for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where does most of the bill go? Subsidies. Large subsidies to corn and soy producers have driven down the price of these commodity crops. Corn-based products have surged in the past decades; cheap corn has become a staple in highly processed foods: soft drinks, sweetened breakfast cereals, etc. Cows are now given corn, rather than grass, leading to higher calorie meat along with a higher ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omego-3 fatty acids—a ratio linked to heart disease. Processed foods are in turn cheaper than fruits and vegetables and consequently, consumed more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the country’s current high obesity rates among both adults and children, and high health care costs associated with it, action within the Farm Bill may be a step in the right direction. Currently, policymakers are in the negotiation process for the 2012 Farm Bill and the issue of cutting costs within the bill has led to controversial debates. Some argue for sustaining food assistance programs, while others for cutting down on them in order to save costs. Another option could be to cut the amount of commodity payments. This option could save money and help us stay healthier.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Secretary Price,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to ask the Administration to afford physicians and physician groups credit for the advanced alternative payment model arrangements they conduct in Medicare Advantage (MA) in the implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, MACRA incentivizes a move away from volume-based compensation and towards payment for value and high quality care.&nbsp; MACRA accelerates the transformation of the healthcare delivery system in preparation for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, Medicare Advantage makes up a third of the enrollment in Medicare.&nbsp; In some counties, Medicare Advantage makes up nearly half of all Medicare enrollees.&nbsp; Downstream from health plans, some physicians are paid through risk-based contracts.&nbsp; Other physicians are paid in feefor-service arrangements.&nbsp; Despite providing a higher level of care coordination and better outcomes, in many ways MA payment is on a parallel track to traditional Medicare. Studies have shown1 that alternative payment models in MA deliver care that is of higher quality and lower cost than care delivered in fee-for-service based MA. In fact, a recent publication in the American Journal of Managed Care demonstrated that patients in capitated MA had a six percent higher survival rate, and were 11 percent less likely to visit the Emergency Room and 12 percent less likely to have an inpatient admission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recognizing the advantages of alternative payment models in MA, we call on the Administration to level the playing field and afford risk arrangements in MA the same credit under MACRA as risk arrangements in traditional Medicare.&nbsp; A physician should have equal incentives to take risk in traditional Medicare FFS as in a contract with a Medicare Advantage plan.&nbsp; Leveling the playing field across Medicare will result in better care for patients and more equitable opportunities for physicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>On July 24, President Trumped signed a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/24/trump-executive-orders-drug-pricing-election/"">series</a>&nbsp;of executive order (EOs) focused on reducing Medicare beneficiary and program spending on prescription drugs. One executive order, the details of which were not immediately released, would set prices for drugs in Medicare Part B to no more than the prices paid by a basket of other developed countries, the “most-favored-nation” (MFN) price. Ostensibly this policy would lower prices in the United States, given that the US pays higher prices than these countries. The idea is similar to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/ipi-model"">“International Price Index” (IPI)</a>&nbsp;proposed rule from 2019, although the EOs came with significantly less detail. The President said that he would wait to release the details of the July 24 MFN and give the pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to negotiate a different arrangement to reduce drug prices. The window for those negotiations closed on August 24.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 13, the President&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-lowering-drug-prices-putting-america-first-2/"">released a new version of MFN</a>. This MFN&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;includes linking prices for certain Part D drugs to international prices, in addition to Part B drugs. Both the Part B and D provisions in the latest MFN would operate as a model under CMMI authority. It is unclear whether these would be mandatory or voluntary models.&nbsp;<strong>Read NCHC’s full memo on the Executive Order&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NCHC_-Memo-on-MFN-091420-FINAL.pdf"">here</a>.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) opposes the repeal or defunding of the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility to beneficiaries with incomes at or below 138% of poverty. The repeal or defunding of this option would undermine important reform initiatives at both the state and federal levels and make health care less affordable for millions of Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. They represent—as employees, members, congregants, and volunteers—more than 150 million Americans. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a letter dated January 5th, 2017, Governor Brian Sandoval (R-NV) urged leaders of the House of Representatives to “ensure that individuals, families, children, aged, blind, disabled and mentally ill are not suddenly left without access to the care they need to lead happy productive lives.” We agree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand Medicaid eligibility to more than 11 million Americans, making health care accessible to many who previously lacked affordable coverage options. Putting at risk these states’ achievements or restricting the remaining nineteen states’ flexibility to expand Medicaid would undercut state-level efforts to reform health care and protect the most vulnerable. This alone is sufficient reason to preserve the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility and the enhanced federal financial support which makes that option viable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, NCHC is also gravely concerned that repeal or defunding of Medicaid expansion would roll back the bipartisan achievements of the 114th Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>To support physicians and other clinicians who embrace new high-value models of care, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) took crucial steps to support alignment of payment policies across all payers - including Medicaid. Grappling with a rollback of Medicaid eligibility would consume the attention of state officials and the health care providers who serve Medicaid beneficiaries. This would effectively sideline the nation’s second-largest payer and many of the providers which rely on it- just as MACRA’s historic value-based payment reforms are getting off the ground.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>MACRA also reaffirmed the bipartisan consensus that has sustained two crucial parts of our safety net: community health centers and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Unfortunately, disrupting Medicaid expansion coverage will have disastrous consequences for FQHCs, which rely on Medicaid for 44% of their revenue. Additionally, he added strain on state budgets occasioned by repeal or defunding of Medicaid expansion could limit states’ investments in children’s coverage, including CHIP.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Just last year, to improve and expand treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, Congress passed two landmark pieces of legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the mental health provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. Eliminating the Medicaid expansion coverage which makes treatment possible for adults earning at or below 138% of the federal poverty level would move federal policy in the opposite direction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is committed to fixing what is broken in our health system. However, repealing or defunding the state option to expand Medicaid would put at risk recent state health reform initiatives, impair health care access for vulnerable populations and detract from recent, bipartisan federal legislative achievements. We call upon you to reject any repeal or defunding of the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to discussing this issue further and sharing our perspective on health policy issues not addressed in this letter. If you have questions about this or related issues, please contact me directly at&nbsp;jrother@nchc.org&nbsp;or 202-638-7151.</p>

<p>Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Brady, and Ranking Member Neal:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) is a coalition of health care stakeholder organizations committed to promoting an affordable, high-quality health system in the United States. As the nation’s oldest and most diverse group working to achieve comprehensive health reform, we represent more than 100 member organizations, including health care providers, purchasers, payers, and consumers. Collectively, our organizations represent, as employees, members, or congregants, more than 100 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition is pleased to support H.R. 4006, the Community-Based Independence for Seniors Act of 2017. This legislation would establish a demonstration program aimed at helping seniors stay in their homes by furnishing targeted home based services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Home- and Community- Based Services (HCBS) are essential to serving patients where they need it most—and more importantly, where the evidence shows they want to be. HCBS have yielded better outcomes and lower costs for consumers and taxpayers among those dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This bill would test whether targeted use of such services, through a new Community-based Institutional Special Needs Medicare Advantage Plan (CBI-SNP), can deliver similar results for non-Medicaid seniors earning between 100% and 150% of the federal poverty level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal policies targeting high-cost, high-need populations are integral to fixing our health care system as a whole, and NCHC believes this particular model has substantial potential to bring down long-term costs for consumers and on the state and federal levels. NCHC looks forward to working with you to enact this important legislation.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By Margot Sanger-Katz (National Journal)—</em>Whatever the Supreme Court does on Thursday, there’s no time machine for the health care system. Legally, a ruling reversing or eviscerating the Affordable Care Act could bring the country back to 2009. But practically, there’s no going back. In the two years since the health care legislation became law, big players in the industry have begun reshaping their business practices, changing their structures, and altering the<br>rules of play in ways that will be difficult to reverse.&nbsp;June 27, 2012</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By Kate Ackley (Roll Call)—</em>On K Street, waiting for the Supreme Court’s health care ruling goes something like this: schedule post-decision client conference calls, write multiple drafts of talking points for different outcomes, and hole up in a conference room trying to figure out whether constitutional law-speak can translate into English. Every interest with a stake in the health care overhaul — which covers basically every lobbyist in town — has been waiting and speculating on whether the statute survives a constitutional challenge. And they are waiting some more with the decision not due until Thursday.&nbsp;June 26, 2012</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By John Rother (Washington Post)—</em>Because of Medicare’s size and growth, the health-care program has taken center stage on the campaign trail and in Capitol Hill discussions about the federal budget deficit. Medicare covers almost one in six Americans and comprises about 15 percent of the federal budget, but it is often misunderstood. Let’s take a few minutes to separate fact from fiction.&nbsp;February 24, 2012</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By Norman Kahn and John Rother (Health Affairs Blog)—</em>Specialty societies and patient advocates have critical roles to play to help accelerate the benefits of comparative effectiveness research (CER).

<p><em>Please find the PDF version&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/05-12-2017-NCHC-Letter-on-S-870-the-CHRONIC-Care-Act.pdf"">here</a>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May 12, 2017</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Chairman Hatch &amp; Ranking Member Wyden:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write today to offer the National Coalition on Health Care’s support for key provisions of S. 870, the Creating High-Quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act, and to suggest steps to further strengthen the legislation as it moves forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, employers and other payers, and taxpayers. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s largest and leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. Our member organizations represent—as employees, members, congregants, or volunteers—more than 150 million Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC applauds the introduction of this legislation and commends your efforts on chronic care, an issue that is vital to affordability in Medicare and across our health care system. We are pleased to support the following provisions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 201, Providing Continued Access to Medicare Advantage (MA) Special Needs Plans for Vulnerable Populations: MA Special Needs Plans have served as incubators for promising delivery and benefit innovations, enabling plans to develop new ways of managing chronic disease and coordinating care for some of the sickest Medicare enrollees. This important provision ensures that they can continue to play that role.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 301, Adapting Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees: NCHC supports the expansion of the MA VBID demonstration to all fifty states and U.S. territories. As currently implemented, this demonstration includes important beneficiary protections, including the requirement that cost-sharing is reduced rather than increased and uniform notice requirements. The national expansion of this model test can better inform the development of future reforms to align benefit structures with ongoing value-based provider-payment reforms and lower cost barriers to needed care.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 302, Expanding Supplemental Benefits to Meet the Needs of Chronically Ill Medicare Advantage Enrollees: This important provision will ensure plans can deploy services that may not be covered under Medicare but can improve health outcomes and lower costs. Examples of such services should include, but need not be limited to, non-covered transportation, nutrition, in-home support services, behavioral health services, palliative care services, home improvement, communication devices, caregiver training and support, assistive devices, and remote patient monitoring systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Telehealth Provisions: Certain telehealth provisions of the CHRONIC Care Act are consistent with NCHC-supported telehealth legislation—the CONNECT for Health Act (S. 1060). We are pleased to support the following provisions:</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 102, Expanding Access to Home Dialysis Therapy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 304,&nbsp;Providing Accountable Care Organizations the Ability to Expand the Use of Telehealth</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 305, Expanding Use of Telehealth for Individuals with Stroke</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Section 401, Providing Flexibility for Beneficiaries to be Part of an ACO: This provision makes needed improvements to the Medicare Shared Savings Program, including the option to assign beneficiaries to ACOs prospectively in all MSSP tracks and through beneficiary attestation. Should the voluntary attestation provision be enacted, we hope that you will work closely with CMS to ensure a robust coordination and outreach effort that extends beyond mere notification. Properly implemented, Section 401 represents an initial down payment on the reforms that are needed to ensure ACOs realize their potential to improve Original Medicare.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a whole, the introduced legislation has potential to improve health outcomes and lower costs over time. But given the scope of the chronic disease challenge, the Committee can and should do more—particularly with respect to the highest-cost, highest-need beneficiary populations. To that end, we urge improvement in three specific areas of the bill:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Broaden the Expansion of Independence at Home: The expansion of the Independence at Home Practice Demonstration from 10,000 to 15,000 beneficiaries, included in Section 101, would be a constructive step. But given the success of home-based primary care in the IAH Practice Demonstration<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-letter-expressing-support-offering-suggestions-key-provisions-chronic-care-act/#_ftn1"">[1]</a>&nbsp;and previously at the Veterans Health Administration,<a href=""https://nchc.org/nchc-letter-expressing-support-offering-suggestions-key-provisions-chronic-care-act/#_ftn2"">[2]</a>&nbsp;the Committee should not delay a broader expansion. NCHC supports the Independence at Home Act (S. 464), which converts IAH to a nationwide, voluntary program within Medicare. If it is impossible to include full conversion, the Committee should, at a minimum, expand the IAH Practice Demonstration to 50,000 beneficiaries and five years. This would allow providers in additional geographies to gain experience with this transformative care model and broaden the evidentiary base for its formal evaluation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Incorporate Bipartisan Steps to Support Advanced Illness Care: Advanced illness care is an important part of chronic care. During the last Congress, NCHC expressed support for S. 1549 Care Planning Act. We understand that an updated version of that legislation is nearing introduction. At a minimum, we would urge incorporation into the CHRONIC Care Act of provisions supporting advanced illness quality measure development, updating the Medicare and You handbook, and testing an Advanced Illness Care Model. Together, these policy changes can deliver meaningful improvements in outcomes and care experience for Medicare beneficiaries living with advanced stages of cancer, Alzheimer’s, dementia, renal disease, heart failure, or other conditions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Permit MA Plans Flexibility to Invest in Non-covered Telehealth Services: As introduced, Section 303 of the CHRONIC Care Act is an important step forward, but we believe the language should be strengthened to better align with that of the NCHC-supported CONNECT for Health Act (S. 1060). Telehealth is not a separate and distinct service, but rather a modality that enables providers to deliver already covered care in a way that improves health and lowers the cost of care without increasing utilization. An overly prescriptive approach that lists specific services that are and are not permitted may limit innovation and investment in telehealth interventions with potential to achieve significant outcome improvements and cost savings.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, we reiterate NCHC’s support for providing ACOs and other alternative payment model entities increased clarity on their ability to furnish other upstream interventions that Medicare typically does not cover, such as social services, transportation, nutritional therapy, or remote patient monitoring. We regret that the Committee’s interest in this vitally important issue, discussed in the December 2015 Policy Options document, was not directly reflected in the introduced legislation. If this issue remains unaddressed in S. 870, we would encourage the Committee to quickly turn to this topic in subsequent legislative efforts this year.</p>

1642,"<strong>National Coalition on Health Care Launches “<em>Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing”</em></strong>","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""http://www.csrxp.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>New Campaign Will Put a Spotlight on Abuse of Market Power in Drug Pricing and Risks to Patients, Taxpayers, and Future Innovation</em></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington DC – The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), today launched the “Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing” to spotlight what the group characterizes as “unsustainable and abusive” prices for some medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Campaign is led by NCHC President and CEO John Rother and aims to spark a national dialogue about the need to find market-based solutions to the problems caused by the onslaught of new high-priced prescription medicines. Rother pointed specifically to Sovaldi, a drug manufactured by Gilead Pharmaceuticals and used to treat patients with hepatitis C, that has drawn the ire of employers, consumer groups, state Medicaid programs, public health advocates, and payers. The drug is priced at $84,000 per 12 week treatment — or $1,000 per pill, and is often combined with other treatments bringing the total cost closer to $150,000 per patient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sovaldi is the canary in the coal-mine, alerting all of us that disaster is coming unless something is done to prevent it,” said John Rother, whose group includes more than 80 organizations, representing employers, purchasers, providers, and consumers. “Unfortunately, the problem is far bigger than one drug – we are talking about a tsunami of expensive medicines that could literally bankrupt the health care system.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Jack Lewin, Chairman of the NCHC board and former CEO of the California Medical Association and the American College of Cardiology said, “Our health care system cannot sustain these continued escalating drug prices. Stakeholders across the health care system need to work together to solve this problem – and pharmaceutical companies are going to have to come to the table and be part of the solution.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rother noted that the system of new drug innovation has produced some remarkable results and that his group wanted to protect and encourage future innovation. “Innovation isn’t sustainable if the system can’t afford it – part of the social contract is that innovators need to balance their profits with the public good.” Rother added that, “Sovaldi looks very much like an abuse of market power and we are going to shine a light on it and see what happens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AARP, which represents more than 37 million consumers over age 50 reinforced the coalition’s concerns. According to Debra Whitman, AARP’s Executive Vice President for Policy, Strategy and International Affairs, “The debate surrounding the introduction of Sovaldi is part of a much larger issue: escalating specialty drug prices that will impact everyone in the health care system, regardless of whether they are taking one themselves, through increased premiums and cost sharing. We applaud NCHC for taking on this issue through its new Campaign for Sustainable Drug Pricing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue of higher cost drugs, especially “specialty drugs”, is only going to become more critical to deal with in the coming years. One estimate notes that by 2020, spending on specialty drugs will quadruple from $87 billion to more than $400 billion. This continued growth in spending will put significant upward pressure on premiums in the private marketplace as well as in public programs like Medicare. The threat to the economy is a real concern and business leaders have expressed dismay at the rising cost of new medicines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to David Lansky, President and CEO of the Pacific Business Group on Health, “The pricing of new, specialty drugs poses serious challenges to those who pay for health care, and Sovaldi is just the first of many similar drugs that are in the pipeline. Stakeholders will need to work together and develop new approaches for drug approvals, treatment indications, and financing to ensure that all patients who need these emerging treatments can afford and benefit from them.”</p>

<p><strong>NCHC Joins Over 60 Health Care Stakeholders in a Letter Urging Congress to Repeal the SGR During the Lame Duck Session</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON D.C.-This afternoon, the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) joined 63 other leading health care stakeholders in a letter to Congressional leaders&nbsp;calling for the passage of legislation to repeal the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, reform payment for physicians and other health professionals, and address crucial healthcare “extenders” during the lame duck session of Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Repeated temporary have only put off the need for permanent reform and prolonged the threat of staggering reimbursement cuts that would threaten Medicare beneficiaries’ access to care,” said NCHC President and CEO John Rother. “Businesses, consumers, and health care providers agree that now is the time for Congress to act.”</p>

<p>The text of the letter and signatories are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>November 13, 2014</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Pelosi:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We write to you today urging you to consider and pass bipartisan-bicameral legislation to repeal the flawed Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, reform payment for physicians and other health professionals, and address the equally important healthcare “extenders,” during the lame duck session of Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you are well aware, Congress has struggled with the threat that the SGR formula poses to reimbursement for physicians and other health professionals and to access to care for seniors and disabled Americans. Sixteen temporary legislative SGR patches have been enacted since 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, while Congress has long debated and acknowledged the flaws of the SGR formula, these repeated short-term patches leave healthcare providers uncertain about payment rates they will receive year after year. Without both repeal of SGR and broader improvements to reimbursement, Medicare payment policy will continue to disadvantage physicians and health professionals who provide better care at lower costs. The result of this volume centric approach will be ever-increasing costs for consumers, employers and taxpayers. We note that far more federal dollars have been spent through these short-term patches than what would have been spent if long ago the formula had been addressed permanently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are encouraged that-for the first time since problems arose from the SGR-Congress has developed comprehensive bipartisan, bicameral legislation, with input from stakeholders, to permanently fix the formula and better reward providers for improvements in patient care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congress has a unique opportunity to act during the lame duck session of Congress to pass this vitally important legislation and start the 114th Congress without another looming SGR deadline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We urge you to work together to enact permanent SGR repeal, payment reform and extenders legislation, and stand ready to work with you to achieve that goal.</p>

<p><strong>NCHC Joins Diverse Effort to Curb Health Care Spending While Improving Quality<br></strong><em>Unlikely partnership releases five integrated recommendations to improve health care</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington, D.C.—NCHC joined four other organizations representing diverse constituencies involved in the nation’s health care to present five consensus recommendations today for improving health care quality while lowering costs nationwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calling itself the Partnership for Sustainable Health Care, the group includes nationally prominent advocates for employers, insurers, consumers, health care providers and others. Participants include America’s Health Insurance Plans, Ascension Health, Families USA, National Coalition on Health Care and Pacific Business Group on Health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These five ideas are game-changers that can place our health system on a sustainable path.&nbsp;Together, they can provide significant long-term relief for families and businesses facing rising costs and uneven quality,” said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care. “By encouraging new forms of health care delivery and spending our health care dollars more wisely, they can produce the real health-cost reform that our elected leaders in Washington have been searching for.”</p>

<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) joined with prominent organizations representing physicians, hospitals, and ACOs to push for reform to the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) in a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MSSP-ACO.Collaborative.Final_.pdf"">comment letter</a>&nbsp;submitted today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we’re going to evolve beyond today’s costly, underperforming volume-based health care, Medicare must do more to expand the MSSP and help providers move to more advanced models,” said John Rother, NCHC’s President and CEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with NCHC, the letter’s signatories include American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, American Medical Association, American Medical Group Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, Collaborative Health Systems, Medical Group Management Association, National Association of ACOs, Premier healthcare alliance, Trinity Health, and a subsidiary of Universal American. The letter was submitted in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)’s proposed rule on the MSSP, Medicare’s premier ACO initiative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure the MSSP delivers on its potential, the letter offers 35 pages of detailed recommendations aimed at five key priorities:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Strengthening the process of assigning Medicare beneficiaries;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Providing better and timelier data.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proposals outlined in the letter would also allow beneficiaries to choose an ACO to be responsible for their care and, at the ACO’s prerogative, receive certain primary care services without cost-sharing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>The National Coalition on Health Care joined the Healthcare Leadership Council and 80 other organizations on a letter urging House leadership to consider and pass S. 870, the CHRONIC Care Act.&nbsp; That legislation, aimed at improving the management of chronic disease along with expanding innovative care delivery models, passed the Senate by unanimous consent on September 26th of this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Addressing rising costs of treating chronic disease is central to making our health system more affordable for all. This common-sense bill takes meaningful steps to strengthen chronic care in Medicare. It’s time Congress sent this bill&nbsp;to the President’s desk,” said John Rother, President and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undersigned organizations are writing to you to express our support for S. 870, the “Creating High-Quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act.”&nbsp; We were proud to have been part of the Senate Finance Committee Chronic Care Working Group’s efforts to develop this legislation, and we look forward to working with the House of Representatives to advance the bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>S. 870 represents an important step forward in ensuring that the two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries who have multiple chronic conditions are able to receive the quality care they need to live a healthy life.&nbsp; Currently, the treatment of chronic illness accounts for almost 93 percent of Medicare spending.&nbsp; The CHRONIC Care Act would lower costs by improving disease management, streamlining care coordination services, and expanding access to innovative models of care.&nbsp; The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the bill would reduce direct spending for Medicare and Medicaid by $217 million from 2018-2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>S. 870 passed the Senate under a unanimous consent agreement.&nbsp; Additionally, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have passed parts of the legislation as separate bills.&nbsp; We urge the full House to quickly consider and pass the provisions of the CHRONIC Care Act so that beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions can get the care that they need to manage their health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your attention to this important issue.&nbsp; We look forward to continuing to work with you.</p>

1650,"NCHC, Health Centers, Physicians Urge Congress to Avoid the 2017 Primary Care Cliff","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC - At a Capitol Hill forum yesterday, The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), and three leading primary care physician societies urged Congress to avoid an approaching funding cliff for health centers and workforce programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Chronic disease is extremely costly. Primary care is the affordable solution—one that works to improve outcomes while reducing costs,” stated NCHC President &amp; CEO John Rother. “For lawmakers looking for a bipartisan approach to health care, strong, sustained support for primary care would be a great start.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday’s event, entitled<strong>&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;Care:&nbsp;High-Value Care for Underserved Communities,&nbsp;</strong>was the second of three forums on critical primary care challenges, co-hosted by NCHC, NACHC, The American Osteopathic Association (AOA), The American College of Physicians (ACP) and The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and workforce programs in underserved rural and urban communities, such as the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education, were highlighted for their vital roles and in a set of recommendations endorsed by NCHC and its co-hosting organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Community health centers and programs like the National Service Corps are bipartisan health care success stories. But for us to succeed, Congress must not take us over the primary care cliff,” says one of the event’s panelists Brenda Johnson, CEO of La Clinica Health Care, a community health center in Medford, OR.</p>

<p>America’s health costs are extraordinarily high and rising. Total national health expenditures represented 17 percent of the Gross National Product in 2010 and are projected to reach nearly 20 percent by 2020 and more than 40 percent by 2050. Yet according to the Institute of Medicine, approximately one third of this enormous investment is poised to be spent on goods and services that improve no one’s health<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Clearly America’s health system faces a crisis of value.</p>

<p>These National Coalition on Health Care Issue Briefs and Fact Sheets are part of a series, designed to explore issues and priorities related to addressing this crisis.

1652,"NCHC: Drug Pricing Primer","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High prescription drug prices contribute to high total health care costs in the United States. Prices in the United States are higher than any other developed country, outpacing the effects of volume, types of drugs, or population size on total drug spending. Retail prescription drugs accounted for 9% of the $3.6 trillion (17.7% of GDP) spent on health care in the U.S. Retail prescription drugs, however, will account for a smaller percentage of total spending as specialty pharmaceuticals and gene or cell therapies, especially those administered by a physician or in the hospital, continue to grow in number and price. Specialty drugs and drugs provided in hospital or outpatient settings are among the most expensive for the system and for consumers. A variety of factors lead to high drug prices in the United States, such as monopolistic pricing, the opaque and complex nature of the system, anti-competitive behavior, and lobbying efforts to prevent an independent system of pricing based on a drug’s value.

<p><strong>NCHC Enthusiastically Applauds Broader Medicare Coverage for Diabetes Prevention Program<br></strong><em>Statement by NCHC President and CEO John Rother</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care enthusiastically applauds the administration’s support for expanding the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) to Medicare beneficiaries across the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to curb the cost of chronic disease is to prevent onset of the disease in the first place. More than a decade of real-world evidence has demonstrated that pre-diabetics who participate in the Diabetes Prevention Program develop diabetes at lower rates than comparable populations. That’s why NCHC has been proud to join with other stakeholders and Congressional champions in calling for coverage of the DPP under Medicare.&nbsp; With today’s announcement, we learned that a pilot test of the DPP actually reduced Medicare expenditures while holding down the incidence of diabetes. HHS now has the clear authority to expand the DPP under current law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With more than half of Medicare enrollees estimated to have pre-diabetes, the expansion of the DPP is critically important. But now Congress must take the next steps by bolstering discretionary federal funding for proven prevention programs like the DPP&nbsp;<strong>and by proceeding with broader chronic care legislation under development in the Senate Finance Committee</strong>.”</p>

<p>Washington, DC—The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), joined by leading consumer and disease organizations, medical societies,&nbsp;business organizations, and pension funds, urged a bipartisan effort to repeal the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) payment formula and&nbsp; transition toward value-based reimbursement in Medicare in a&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Final-SGR-Payment-Reform-Letter.pdf"">letter</a>&nbsp;sent to Congressional chairmen Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No longer is this just a physicians’ issue. Payment approaches based on value, not volume, are essential to affordability for consumers, payers and taxpayers,” said NCHC President and CEO John Rother.&nbsp;The letter was addressed to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT), House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since its enactment in 1997, the SGR has threatened to impose across-the-board cuts to reimbursement for physicians and other providers paid through Medicare the physician fee schedule. Congress has responded with a series of temporary measures to avert the cuts. However, this year, a newly reduced estimate of the budgetary impact of a permanent repeal has sparked renewed interest in a longer-term solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter, released today, backs a permanent repeal of the SGR, but it also urges broader reforms to addressing the cost and quality challenges facing America’s health system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today’s physicians are caught between innovative approaches to care that help us spend health care dollars more wisely and the persistence of the old volume-based approaches that rack up bills without necessarily serving the best interests of patients. If Congress acts this year, Medicare can help accelerate a system-wide transition toward better care at lower costs,” said Dr. Jack Lewin, internal medicine physician and Chair of the NCHC Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Dear Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) opposes the repeal or defunding of the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility to beneficiaries with incomes at or below 138% of poverty. The repeal or defunding of this option would undermine important reform initiatives at both the state and federal levels and make health care less affordable for millions of Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. Our members and supporters include nearly 90 of America’s leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans. They represent—as employees, members, congregants, and volunteers—more than 150 million Americans. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a letter dated January 5th, 2017, Governor Brian Sandoval (R-NV) urged leaders of the House of Representatives to “ensure that individuals, families, children, aged, blind, disabled and mentally ill are not suddenly left without access to the care they need to lead happy productive lives.” We agree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand Medicaid eligibility to more than 11 million Americans, making health care accessible to many who previously lacked affordable coverage options. Putting at risk these states’ achievements or restricting the remaining nineteen states’ flexibility to expand Medicaid would undercut state-level efforts to reform health care and protect the most vulnerable. This alone is sufficient reason to preserve the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility and the enhanced federal financial support which makes that option viable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, NCHC is also gravely concerned that repeal or defunding of Medicaid expansion would roll back the bipartisan achievements of the 114th Congress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. To support physicians and other clinicians who embrace new high-value models of care, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) took crucial steps to support alignment of payment policies across all payers - including Medicaid. Grappling with a rollback of Medicaid eligibility would consume the attention of state officials and the health care providers who serve Medicaid beneficiaries. This would effectively sideline the nation’s second-largest payer and many of the providers which rely on it- just as MACRA’s historic value-based payment reforms are getting off the ground.<br>2. MACRA also reaffirmed the bipartisan consensus that has sustained two crucial parts of our safety net: community health centers and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Unfortunately, disrupting Medicaid expansion coverage will have disastrous consequences for FQHCs, which rely on Medicaid for 44% of their revenue. Additionally, he added strain on state budgets occasioned by repeal or defunding of Medicaid expansion could limit states’ investments in children’s coverage, including CHIP.<br>3. Just last year, to improve and expand treatment for mental illness and substance abuse, Congress passed two landmark pieces of legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the mental health provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. Eliminating the Medicaid expansion coverage which makes treatment possible for adults earning at or below 138% of the federal poverty level would move federal policy in the opposite direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is committed to fixing what is broken in our health system. However, repealing or defunding the state option to expand Medicaid would put at risk recent state health reform initiatives, impair health care access for vulnerable populations and detract from recent, bipartisan federal legislative achievements. We call upon you to reject any repeal or defunding of the state option to expand Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the weeks and months ahead, we look forward to discussing this issue further and sharing our perspective on health policy issues not addressed in this letter.

1660,"NCHC comments on Medicare Advantage Telehealth Benefits","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 31st, 2018, the National Coalition on Health Care commented on CMS’ requirements for Medicare Advantage plans that offer additional telehealth benefits. NCHC noted that the “current limitations on the use of telehealth services are antiquated,” pointing to the fact that it was estimated that only 0.25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries were able to utilize telehealth services in 2016. Additionally, NCHC noted that the Veterans Administration (VA), has historically been able to benefit substantially from the use of telehealth care.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Medicare Advantage (MA) and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit programs (CMS-4182-P).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation’s largest, most broadly representative nonpartisan alliance of organizations focused on health care. The Coalition is committed to advancing—through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high-value health care system for patients and consumers, for employers and other payers, and for taxpayers. Our members and supporters include more than 80 of America’s leading associations of health care providers, businesses and unions, consumer and patient advocacy groups, pension and health funds, religious denominations, and health plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, NCHC is encouraged that CMS is actively pursuing improvements to the Medicare Advantage program. We are particularly pleased that the agency is using the rulemaking process to engage the full range of stakeholder and public perspectives on its proposals. Nearly one in three Medicare beneficiaries exercise their option to receive Medicare benefits through MA Plans. In addition to providing important coverage choices, a well-functioning MA program has the potential to advance delivery, payment, and benefit reforms that will improve health care affordability overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our specific comments on the proposed rule are detailed below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Implementation of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA)</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC supports the provision of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 that would limit opioid prescriptions to specific prescribers and pharmacies for at-risk beneficiaries. We are encouraged that CMS is promulgating regulations to implement these important provisions of law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Flexibility in Medicare Advantage Uniformity Requirements (§422.100(d))</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS has now determined that statute permits MA organizations to reduce cost sharing for certain covered benefits; offer tailored, health-related supplemental benefits; and offer lower deductibles for enrollees that meet specific medical criteria, provided that similarly situated enrollees (that is, all enrollees who meet the identified criteria) are treated the same. Reviews of plan designs could still serve to prevent cost-sharing from discriminating against high-cost beneficiaries. Also, CMS notes that the new flexibility would still prohibit an MA plan from denying, limiting, or conditioning the coverage or provision of a service or benefit based on health status-related factors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC supports allowing plans to reduce cost-sharing for certain benefits, tailor supplemental benefits, and vary deductibles for patients with specific medical criteria. Experience with such value-based insurance design (VBID) in employer plans shows that it can increase use of high-value treatments and providers in ways that lower overall costs and disease burden over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reduced cost-sharing for highly effective preventive services and chronic care therapies addresses financial barriers that can prevent people from getting needed care and improves adherence to high-value treatments. This in turn can prevent costly complications and yield net savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is already substantial evidence on the powerful benefits of VBID:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Private employers like Pitney Bowes have found significant savings through reduced cost-sharing for essential diabetes treatments.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Oregon’s Public Employees’ Benefit Board and the Oregon Educators Benefit Board’s extensive VBID program improved HEDIS scores, increased use of preventive services, and provided substantial savings.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services prominently features VBID in its National Quality Strategy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The University of Michigan Center for Value-Based Insurance Design tracks case studies and more at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sph.umich.edu/vbidcenter"">http://www.sph.umich.edu/vbidcenter</a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This evidence provides more than a sufficient basis to incorporate VBID throughout the Medicare Advantage program even as the Medicare Advantage-specific VBID demonstration program progresses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the proposed rule either lacks clarity or may not explicitly permit several important flexibilities, such as using relevant non-medical criteria (i.e. functional status, homelessness, income, living alone) to target tailored benefits, the ability to completely eliminate rather than reduce cost-sharing, and the ability to reduce cost-sharing for a subset of high-quality network providers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;We support the proposal and encourage CMS to finalize it. At the same time, CMS should provide additional clarification either in the final rule or in subsequent guidance. Specifically, NCHC encourages the agency to permit plan sponsors to</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use non-medical factors as a criterion for a tailored benefits, such as living alone, low income status, or difficulties with ADLs or IADLs;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Allow plans to eliminate the plan level deductible and cost-sharing (make $0), not just reduce them to a non-zero level; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reduce cost-sharing only for a subset of high-quality network providers, as long as all members with the specified medical conditions receive the same lower cost-sharing for using these providers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, even as CMS implements VBID approaches in MA, we note that Advanced APM models bear accountability for clinical outcomes and beneficiary costs – albeit in a different manner than MA plans. NCHC encourages you to explore the ways in which ACOs and provider organizations participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program and CMMI demonstrations might apply the principles of VBID and flexible benefits reflected in this proposed rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Meaningful Differences in MA Bid Submission and Bid Review (§§422.254 and 422.256)</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS proposes to eliminate the meaningful difference requirement for MA organizations (§§422.254(a)(4) and 422.256(b)(4) beginning in CY 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC’s member organizations have a broad range of positions with respect to meaningful difference requirements. However, NCHC does note that this proposal to add flexibility for plans could add complexity for beneficiaries. Currently, on average, beneficiaries have a choice of 21 MA plans. In 206 counties, beneficiaries chose among more than 30 plans for the 2018 plan year.1 1 Jacobson, G, Damico, A., and Neuman, T. Medicare Advantage 2018 Data Spotlight: First Look. Available at: https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2018-data-spotlight-first-look/</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In proposing these changes, CMS has expressed confidence that improvements in the Plan Finder, the only tool for plan comparison, will help beneficiaries to navigate the new complexities. We appreciate that CMS is developing Plan Finder enhancements. Beneficiary choice is meaningless if beneficiaries do not have the tools to reasonably exercise that choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;In the event that CMS proceeds to implement this proposal, such implementation must be matched with an aggressive effort to ensure that beneficiaries have adequate tools to evaluate and compare their choices. The Annual Notice of Change (ANOC), where practicable, should be used to inform beneficiaries about providers’ exits from a plan network, the plan formulary changes, and where utilization management tools will be newly applied. The Plan Finder should include information about provider networks, office visit and service copays, and coinsurances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Medical Loss Ratio</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS proposes to allow anti-fraud activities and Medication Therapy Management (MTM) under the MLR standard for Medicare Part C/D plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;Both anti-fraud efforts and MTM programs help to improve quality, and should count, as other quality efforts already do. Fraud, for example, can include claims for needed care not delivered and the delivery of unnecessary care, both of which have potential to cause physical as well as financial harm to enrollees. MTM programs focus on appropriate drug utilization among patients with complex care needs, for whom inappropriate utilization can be common and especially problematic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;We support adding anti-fraud efforts and Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program costs to what counts as medical spending for the medical loss ratio.</p>

<h5>Star Ratings after Consolidation of Contracts</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS proposes a new set of rules for the calculation of Star Ratings for consolidated contracts. In most cases, the Star Ratings for the first and second years following the consolidation would be an enrollment-weighted mean of the scores at the measure level for all contracts (that is, consumed and surviving contracts). For the QBP rating for the first year following the consolidation, CMS proposes to use the enrollment-weighted mean of the QBP rating of the surviving and consumed contracts (which would be the overall or summary rating depending on the plan type) rather than averaging measure scores. In subsequent years after the consolidation, CMS would determine QBP status based on the consolidated entity’s Star Ratings displayed on the Medicare Plan Finder (MPF).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;For Medicare Part C to deliver on its promise of competition and value, beneficiaries need an accurate and understandable sense of the quality of the choices available in the market. We, like the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and others, believe it is important to change current policy that lets plans apply a higher rating from a remaining contract to lowerrated plans in other states when issuers consolidate contracts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe CMS’ proposal in this regard is a constructive improvement compared to the status quo. However, it appears insufficient to fully assure quality transparency and choice of plans. MedPAC elaborated on this insufficiency in its recent response to this NPRM:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>”The averaging method would only give an accurate picture of quality in a given geographic area if the two or more contracts involved in a given consolidation shared exactly the same service area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the current cycle of contract consolidations (the end of 2017), there were 17 contract consolidations in which a contract below 4 stars was consumed by a contract at or above 4 stars. In only one of the cases was there any overlap of service areas.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hence, even with the proposed use of enrollment-weighted averages of scores among consolidating plans, some lower-rated parts of consolidated contracts would receive higher scores than they have earned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;We urge CMS to finalize the existing proposal while continuing to consider additional options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Expedited Substitutions of Certain Generics and Other Midyear Formulary Changes (§§423.100, 423.120, and 423.128)</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS proposes to revise regulations to permit Part D sponsors to immediately remove or change the preferred or tiered cost-sharing of brand name drugs when the sponsor replaces the brand drug with (or adds to their formularies) therapeutically-equivalent newly-approved generics. CMS would permit these substitutions and changes to occur at any time without advance approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC believes that enhanced competition from generic drugs is a powerful tool to restrain costs and improve affordability. We greatly appreciate the additional formulary flexibility that CMS proposes to offer Part D sponsors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC supports CMS’ proposal to permit midyear changes and to allow them to proceed without advance approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Treatment of Follow-on Biological Products as Generics for Non-LIS Catastrophic and LIS Cost Sharing (423.4)</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>&nbsp;CMS proposes to revise the definition of generic drugs at §423.4 to include follow-on biological products approved under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act solely for the purposes of non-LIS catastrophic and LIS cost-sharing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, because biosimilar and interchangeable biological products do not meet CMS’ definition of a generic drug, they are subject to the higher Part D maximum copayments for LIS beneficiaries and non-LIS enrollees in the catastrophic portion of the benefit. CMS’ proposal would ensure that follow-on biological products will be more affordable for beneficiaries than more expensive reference biological products. It will thereby reduce costs to both Part D enrollees and the Part D program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC supports CMS’ proposal and recommends finalizing as proposed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Price Concessions to Drug Prices at Point of Sale</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Request for Information:</strong>&nbsp;CMS is soliciting comment on requiring plan sponsors to provide a percentage of manufacturer rebates and pharmacy price concessions in the negotiated price at point of sale. Comments may inform future rulemaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;We are pleased to see CMS exploring ways to reduce cost barriers to needed prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and soliciting comment from the full range of stakeholders prior to proposing immediate regulatory change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, given the complex arrangements between and among plan sponsors, pharmacies, and manufacturers, careful consideration of the consequences of any possible change is needed. NCHC has identified at least three causes for concern with the contemplated policies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cost-shifting, not cost-saving: CMS’ own analysis shows that reduced beneficiary burden at point of sale would generate increased costs elsewhere. Specifically, Table 10A indicates that point of sale manufacturer rebates would yield between $9.2 billion and $28.3 billion (a 4-11%increase) in beneficiary premium costs, and $27.3 and $82.1 billion in added cost to federal taxpayers (a 2-6% increase). According to Table 11, applying this requirement to pharmacy price concessions would similarly generate $5.7 billion in added premium costs and $16.6 billion in added taxpayer costs. In both cases, the added cost to beneficiaries and taxpayers combined exceed the reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures. This is not a costsaving policy, it is a cost-shifting policy—with negative consequences for premium affordability and the Federal Treasury.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ignoring the root cause: The root cause of the increasing unaffordability of prescription drugs lies in the underlying price of the drugs themselves, as reflected in unsustainable launch prices and ongoing price inflation of drugs already on the market. This proposal does not directly address the underlying lack of transparency, competition, and value in prescription drug market itself.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Potentially encouraging drug price inflation: NCHC is concerned that the reduction in manufacturer coverage gap responsibilities associated with the manufacturer rebate policy amounts to a Medicare-financed windfall to manufacturers. This windfall would serve to lessen what pressure does exist today for manufacturers to restrain list prices.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong>&nbsp;NCHC remains very interested in reducing cost barriers for needed care and addressing the underlying problems with pharmaceutical prices. But given the consequences described above, NCHC could not support any proposal to implement the specific options described in this RFI.</p>

<p><strong>Re: Medicare Program; Cancellation of Advancing Care Coordination Through Episode Payment and Cardiac Rehabilitation Incentive Payment Models; Changes to Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Payment Model (CMS-5524-P)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Administrator Verma:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write to share the comments of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Cancellation of the Advancing Care Coordination Through Episode Payment and Cardiac Rehabilitation Incentive Payment Models and Changes to the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Payment Model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization representing more than 80 participating organizations, including medical societies, businesses, unions, health care providers, faith-based associations, pension and health funds, insurers, and groups representing consumers, patients, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The Coalition is committed to advancing— through research and analysis, education, outreach, and informed advocacy—an affordable, high value health care system for patients and consumers, payers, employers, and taxpayers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Episodic bundled payment models are an essential step in the evolution away from volume-based medicine and toward more affordable, person-centered health care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC enthusiastically agrees with CMS that “cardiac and orthopedic episode models offer opportunities to redesign processes and improve quality and care coordination across the inpatient and post-acute care spectrum while lowering spending.” For this very reason, NCHC has strongly supported the expansion of episodic bundling models and previously argued against changes to those models that could constrict opportunities for clinician participation in Advanced Alternative Payment Models (AAPM). Additionally, we have been concerned about the market signal that CMS’ decisions could have on private providers and payers who are adopting bundled payment approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is clear that CMS now seeks to reconcile a strong preference for voluntary model design with its continued interest in episodic bundled payment models. Therefore, our comments focus on helping CMS strike the best balance possible, while prioritizing the need to provide broad opportunities for AAPM participation beginning in CY 2018.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the event that CMS finalizes a reduction in scope of the CJR Demonstration’s mandatory component, NCHC would support maintaining mandatory participation for some portion of the previously selected geographic areas.</strong>&nbsp;We would further agree that the selection of the highest cost geographic areas is the most appropriate approach, and we would urge CMS not to reduce the number of mandatory MSAs below 34. We also support allowing optional CJR participation in any selected geographic area where participation is no longer mandatory. Additionally, NCHC supports providing flexibility for low-volume and rural hospitals to participate on an optional basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Given the success of Lower-Extremity Joint Replacement bundles in the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Model (BPCI) and CJR Year 1, we encourage CMS to consider expanding the reach of the proposed voluntary component of the CJR model on a nationwide basis.</strong>&nbsp;This would effectively provide more clinicians, particularly specialty clinicians, a viable pathway to qualify as an AAPM under MACRA. Such an expansion, on a voluntary basis, could mitigate the market signal that scaling back CJR would have on private providers and payers which are adopting bundled payment approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Cardiac Rehabilitation Incentive Model</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCHC strongly urges CMS to reconsider its proposed cancellation of the Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) Incentive Payment Model in light of the proactive participant investments made in preparation for this model.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overwhelming clinical evidence supports this care model and the underlying hypothesis that broader access to rehabilitation services will improve patient outcomes for beneficiaries following an AMI or CABG episode of care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physician practices, other health professionals, and health systems have been preparing to implement this model and stand to lose those investments. Since the model was finalized, providers in the selected geographic areas have made infrastructure and human resource investments in anticipation of the new incentive payment model. These expenditures have included hiring new staff, purchasing and deploying new IT platforms, and modifying operations, with the reasonable expectation of a return on investment when the performance period commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recognize that some previous commenters, as noted in the NPRM, identified issues with direct supervision and the potential for model overlap. We believe these issues can be addressed without cancelling the model. Rather, in light of the investments already made in preparation for its implementation, the CR model should move forward as soon as possible in calendar year (CY) 2018. NCHC encourages CMS to work with the relevant stakeholders—including the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Association of Cardiovascular Pulmonary Rehabilitation—to ensure that it does.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":5} -->
<h5>Episodic Payment Model</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the event that CMS finalizes its proposal to cancel the episodic cardiac models, CMS should ensure that episodic bundled payments for AMI and CABG are available on a voluntary basis to clinicians and providers as soon as possible in CY 2018.</strong>&nbsp;Given that Medicare’s experience with cardiac bundles dates to the 1990s, those opportunities should be available nationwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, providers and health professionals have made plans and investments in preparation for this model. And while the NPRM indicates that “providers interested in participating may still have an opportunity to do so during CY 2018,” the mere possibility of a not-yet-released model is not sufficient to enable providers to prepare. NCHC urges CMS, in consultation with key stakeholders, to rapidly introduce that model, allow participation in the EPM’s AMI or CABG bundles on a voluntary basis, and/or otherwise ensure that episodic bundled payment options are available to clinicians across the country early in 2018.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Providers and clinicians that believe a bundled payment approach is the best option to deliver care should not have that option denied to them—to the detriment of their patients and the Medicare program. Furthermore, we believe that expanding opportunities for participation in cardiac bundling on a voluntary basis, could, to some degree, mitigate the market signal that scaling back EPM would have on private providers and payers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should you have questions regarding these comments or other issues with respect to the affected models, please contact NCHC’s Policy Director, Larry McNeely at&nbsp;lmcneely@nchc.org&nbsp;or 202-638-7151.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC commends Chairmen Camp and Baucus, along with Ranking Members Hatch and Levin, &nbsp;for a landmark proposal that would&nbsp;end the threat of SGR-driven provider cuts and will help keep Medicare affordable over the long-term.&nbsp;Their revised discussion draft reflects a strong bipartisan consensus among health care stakeholders and experts on the need to move past today’s volume-based payment system to value-based approaches and innovative models of health care delivery.&nbsp;While Congress must still identify ways to pay for the proposed SGR reform that avoid cost-shifting and blunt cuts to beneficiaries or providers, the growing bipartisan congressional momentum behind reform is good news for both Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers. NCHC urges&nbsp;both&nbsp;Committees to promptly advance this important legislation to the full House and Senate.</p>

As structured under current law, the IPAB does have flaws, but Congress has yet to unite around an alternative approach to curb Medicare or systemwide cost growth over the long term. With health care costs continuing to squeeze families and employers alike, rolling back existing cost containment mechanisms is ill-advised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Instead, going forward, let’s hope lawmakers keep their focus on bipartisan improvements that actually curb costs and improve care.”</p>

<p><strong>NCHC Backs Elements of MACRA Rule, But Expresses Concern About Flaws in APM Proposals</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WASHINGTON, DC— In comments submitted today to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), an alliance of leading national health care,&nbsp;consumer, labor and business groups, combined&nbsp;support for elements of CMS’ approach to MACRA implementation with concern that a few flawed provisions could undermine the law’s objective of promoting alternative payment models (APMs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<strong>There is a great deal to like in the proposed rule. But CMS must fix some crucial problems or risk discouraging participation in the APMs that MACRA was designed to promote</strong>,” said NCHC President and CEO John Rother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the letter, NCHC praises CMS for proposals that emphasize outcome-based quality metrics, as well as its efforts to establish a glide path toward broader participation in APMs and Advanced APMs.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;NCHC does identify substantive problems with the rule’s provisions related to alternative payment models, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the exclusion of episodic bundling models other than the Oncology Care Model from both the MIPS APM and the Advanced APM categories;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>provisions which could slow providers’ embrace of Advanced APMs within Medicare Advantage; and</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>a flawed framework for determination of Qualifying and Partially Qualifying Advanced APM Participants which discourages participation in Advanced APM models.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC was a strong supporter of MACRA’s enactment, arguing that the legislation was vital to health care affordability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“More affordable health care demands that we must successfully move beyond volume-centric, fee-for-service medicine,” said Rother. “That’s why it’s so important to get this law’s implementation right.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC)&nbsp;appeals to&nbsp;Congress to get serious about SGR reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the House approved a bill that married&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;bipartisan reforms with a&nbsp;&nbsp;politically charged pay-for, a five-year delay of the individual insurance mandate.&nbsp;The only savings that their chosen offset would generate come at&nbsp;the expense of consumers. Millions in state insurance marketplaces would face 10-20% rate hikes, and millions more would go without coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senate majority’s approach is superior.&nbsp;As introduced by Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) this week, the Senate bill avoids the outright cost-shifting included in the House package. It also&nbsp;includes extensions of certain expiring health care “extenders”&nbsp;that are vital to vulnerable beneficiaries.&nbsp;Senate passage of this bill would represent an important step toward&nbsp;reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But without an&nbsp;offset package acceptable to the House, the current Senate language is unlikely to become law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, as soon as possible, the&nbsp;House and Senate&nbsp;need to&nbsp;return to the real work ahead: finding agreement on permanent SGR repeal and the strongest possible provider payment reforms, as well as health care “extenders” and offsets&nbsp;that&nbsp;build&nbsp;on&nbsp;value-based reforms to health care payment, delivery and benefits, without shifting costs to consumers, providers or payers.”</p>

<p><em>Statement from National Coalition on Health Care President and CEO John Rother on the&nbsp;</em><em>Congressional Debate over SGR Reform</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC)&nbsp;appeals to&nbsp;Congress to get serious about SGR reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the House approved a bill that married&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;bipartisan reforms with a&nbsp;&nbsp;politically charged pay-for, a five-year delay of the individual insurance mandate.&nbsp;The only savings that their chosen offset would generate come at&nbsp;the expense of consumers. Millions in state insurance marketplaces would face 10-20% rate hikes, and millions more would go without coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senate majority’s approach is superior.&nbsp;As introduced by Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) this week, the Senate bill avoids the outright cost-shifting included in the House package. It also&nbsp;includes extensions of certain expiring health care “extenders”&nbsp;that are vital to vulnerable beneficiaries.&nbsp;Senate passage of this bill would represent an important step toward&nbsp;reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But without an&nbsp;offset package acceptable to the House, the current Senate language is unlikely to become law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, as soon as possible, the&nbsp;House and Senate&nbsp;need to&nbsp;return to the real work ahead: finding agreement on permanent SGR repeal and the strongest possible provider payment reforms, as well as health care “extenders” and offsets&nbsp;that&nbsp;build&nbsp;on&nbsp;value-based reforms to health care payment, delivery and benefits, without shifting costs to consumers, providers or payers.”</p>

<p>“This compromise bill is not perfect.

<p><em>Letter from the President:</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Friends and Colleagues,<br>Thank you for your dedication to the National Coalition on Health Care. Like many of us, the Coalition has had a challenging yet productive year. We have adapted quickly to a new virtual world and continue to advance around bipartisan, pragmatic policy solutions to create a more affordable health care system for all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guided by our Board of Directors and members, we advocated for timely legislative and regulatory interventions to lower drug prices, address “surprise” out-of-network bills, accelerate value-based care, and, most importantly, address the public health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We amplified educational campaigns of our members through hill briefings, policy meetings, speaking engagements, and social media.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building on this success, we set out in 2021 to do challenging work. The current state of our health system imposes steep costs on the country and the Coalition is determined to address the challenge of reducing the total cost of care. We must pursue innovative value-based payment models and address upstream determinants of health. The Coalition pledges its support to fair and effective measures to enhance affordability and equity, recognizing that change is necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We look forward to our continued partnership in 2021 and beyond.</p>

<p>HEALTH CARE COSTS THREATEN MIDDLE CLASS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(NAPS)-Knowing what to expect can help you prepare for the future-especially when it comes to health care costs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A new study shows U.S. health care costs will rise 2 to 2 1/2 times as fast as the rate of inflation over the next five years. The middle class will be hit the hardest, with middle-income families paying a greater percentage of their in come than any other group.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Married couples with children will pay 5.5 percent above inflation and single-parent families will pay as much as ten percent above inflation for their health care costs, according to the study,&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/implication/implications/"">Changes in the Growth in Health Care Spending: Implications for Consumers</a>, commissioned by the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Costs are expected to increase over the next five years. While increases will affect all income brackets, middle-income households with incomes between $20,000 and $60,000 will lose the highest percentage of their incomes to health ca re inflation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had health care costs remained at a constant share of household budgets during the 1990s, middle-income households would have between $500 and $1000 more to spend or save in 1997.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study estimates the typical family will directly spend $2000 on health care: health insurance, medical services, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies during 1997. Nearly 50 percent of out-of-pocket expenses is due to the high cost of health insurance premiums. Part of why those premiums are so expensive is the high cost of caring for 42 million Americans who are uninsured.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many of America's small businesses will also be affected. Health care expenditures are expected to increase faster than wages at most businesses. The small business community, those who employ fewer than 100 and lack the economic lev erage of larger employers, may pay as much as 6.3 percent more in premiums.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;""Unfortunately, the nation's dominant employer, small business, is already being hit by the return of rising health care costs,"" said Dr. Henry E. Simmons, president of the NCHC. ""With trends indicating a significant increase in healt h insurance premiums, small businesses, without bargaining power, are and will continue to be most at risk.""<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study was funded by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in support of the National Coalition on Health Care's multi-year national campaign to educate the public and business community on the rapidly changing and increasingly comp lex health care system.</p>

1684,"Member Spotlight: Pacific Business Group on Health","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For NCHC’s first Member Spotlight, we are thrilled to feature&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/"">Pacific Business Group on Health</a>&nbsp;(PBGH). PBGH represents the interests of dozens of private and public purchasers working towards the same goal—an improved and innovative healthcare system that benefits the American public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founded as an organization for purchasers, its members include some of the largest national and regional companies in the U.S. By drawing on its members’ own experience testing healthcare innovations, PBGH is able to identify what’s working and help other purchasers bring those models to scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One noteworthy effort has been PBGH’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/iocp"">Intensive Outpatient Care Program (IOCP)</a>, designed to better coordinate care for medically complex and chronically ill patients and, in turn, cut costs and unnecessarily duplicated services. Funded by a three-year Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) grant, IOCP is now operating across five states (CA, WA, AZ, NV, and ID) in partnership with 23 physician groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preliminary data from&nbsp;<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/5/1317.full"">earlier tests of this model</a>&nbsp;with a commercially insured population show a reduction in costs of up to 20%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IOCP is just one of the many&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/programs"">innovative healthcare initiatives</a>&nbsp;led by PBGH.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We applaud PBGH’s unwavering efforts to work towards affordability and efficiency and are pleased to work with them in this ever-changing healthcare environment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
1686,"Member Spotlight: National Multiple Sclerosis Society","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC member National Multiple Sclerosis Society has a bold vision: a world free of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a very aggressive disease affecting the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves in the eyes, and a staggering 2.3 million people worldwide are living with the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National MS Society is working to stop MS in its tracks and enhance the lives of people who are impacted by it. While the Society has chapters and holds events to raise awareness all across the country, it is especially active in its&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Get-Involved/Advocate-for-Change"">advocacy efforts</a>&nbsp;on Capitol Hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National MS Society is pursuing several policy priorities, namely obtaining funding for MS research, advancing home modification policies, increasing access to health care and quality coverage, ensuring Medicaid stabilization, and enhancing transparency of costs and coverage. Though these are all vital policy priorities for MS advocates, they are equally important for anyone living with a disability or illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National MS Society has been an important NCHC ally on value-based payment reform and Medicaid issues, and in recent months, has been speaking out about high prescription drug costs. Furthermore, NCHC recently extended its support to the Society’s efforts to ensure access to complex rehabilitation technology (i.e. power wheelchair lifts and cushions)—a benefit that is key to high-value outcomes and function for some MS patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work the National MS Society is doing is truly invaluable to the health care affordability and access movement. NCHC is proud to partner with an organization committed to its mission of enhancing health care for those who need it most.</p>

1687,"Member Spotlight: Association for Community Affiliated Plans","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.communityplans.net/"">Association for Community Affiliated Plans (ACAP)</a>&nbsp;is a national trade association representing the interests of more than seventeen million enrollees—approximately half of all individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans—through not-for-profit Safety Net Health Plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ACAP is dedicated to bolstering these Safety Net Health Plans with the mission of improving the health of lower-income and vulnerable populations. As an&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.communityplans.net/who-we-serve/"">advocate for their member plans</a>, ACAP works to address social determinants, combat opioid abuse, address childhood obesity, and care for children with special health needs by ensuring coverage for those who are most at risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent months, ACAP has been making great strides in their advocacy through thorough research. In early February 2017, ACAP published a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.communityplans.net/research/csr/"">report on cost-sharing reductions under the ACA</a>. The findings indicated the need for the preservation of these cost-sharing reduction plan payments regardless of what the future holds for the entirety of the ACA. ACAP also recently issued a report on innovative ways Safety Net Health Plans participating in Medicaid managed care programs&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.communityplans.net/research/specialneedscarereport/"">coordinate and improve care for children with special health care needs</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ACAP has been an active participant in NCHC’s programmatic activities. In February 2016, ACAP CEO Margaret A. Murray served as a panelist on NCHC’s forum entitled “<a href=""https://nchc.org/past-event/event_id1-22/"">Improving Chronic Care in Medicare Advantage and Beyond</a>.” We have also enjoyed working toward shared advocacy objectives of a strong Medicaid program, a robust non-group market, and the permanent authorization of the Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNPs) now included in recently introduced Senate chronic care legislation.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is strong and growing recognition of the need for comprehensive health system reform. This has led 15 major groups and individuals to join the National Coalition on Health Care, the nation's largest alliance working to assure high quality, affordable, and cost effective health care to all Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition's current 80 members include large and small businesses, the nation's major labor unions, consumer and religious groups, and all the primary care provider organizations. With the latest additions, the members now include a Foundation and two of the country's largest pension and health insurance benefit funds. Those who have recently become members include:</p>

These new members can contribute immensely to the continuing success of the Coalition in educating the public about the serious problems in our health care system and in bringing about the changes needed to solve these problems.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""These employers, unions, and manageres of our largest retirement funds purchase billions of dollars in health care each year for their employees and members. By joining the Coalition, they have indicated their recognition of the seriousness of the issues facing our health care system and of the need for our nation to address these issues through comprehensive reform,"" said Henry E. Simmons, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., president of the Coalition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCHC is the nation's largest and most broadly represented alliance working to brin about greater public understanding of the problems in our health care system and the reform which will be necessary to address them. The Coalition is non-profit, regorously non-partisan, and is committed to the achievement of five basic principles in our health care system: health insurance for all, improved quality of care, cost containment, equitable financing and simplified administration. Its Honorary Co-Chairs are former Presidents George Bush, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter.</p>

<p>Editor’s note.<em>&nbsp;In addition to Norman Kahn and John Rother (photos and bios above), this post is coauthored by Timothy Lynch, JD, Director of Foundation Programs for the ABIM Foundation; David Hoyt, MD, Executive Director of the American College of Surgeons; and Steven Weinberger, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the American College of Physicians. The newly released December issue of&nbsp;</em>Health Affairs<em>&nbsp;includes&nbsp;<a href=""http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/12/07/comparative-effectiveness-research-opportunities-and-challenges-for-pcori/"">a cluster of articles</a>&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;on comparative effectiveness research and priorities for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specialty societies and patient advocates have critical roles to play to help accelerate the benefits of comparative effectiveness research (CER).&nbsp; With the attention and respect they receive from their physician members, specialty societies are a trusted intermediary that can convey the views of practicing physicians to those sponsoring and conducting research, disseminate research findings widely and effectively, and foster conversations about the research and its importance between patients and physicians.&nbsp; Patient advocates can explain the importance of CER to their constituents, helping to address fears that some may have that CER is a tool to deny needed care.&nbsp; They can also disseminate specific findings to educate patients about the sorts of interventions they should (and should not) request.&nbsp; Below we suggest ten specific steps that specialty societies and patient advocates can take to promote the use of CER.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Research</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty</strong>&nbsp;<strong>societies and patient advocates should urge the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and other entities sponsoring CER to ensure patients and clinicians play active roles in designing CER studies and identifying the research questions to be studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>CER can be too far removed from the concerns of clinical practitioners and patients to be of value.&nbsp; Studies should be designed to inform the real-world decisions physicians and patients must make, and including clinicians and informed patients in the design process would help.&nbsp; Societies could help train clinicians to participate effectively in the CER process, and advocates could train patients, who are often concerned about outcomes—such as those related to quality of life—that may not be apparent to researchers or clinicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should help ensure that reports produced by the researchers undertaking CER studies are written to maximize their value for physicians and patients</strong>.&nbsp; CER reports conducted under PCORI’s purview are expected to convey research findings in an accessible way.&nbsp; Societies and patient advocates should review those reports and provide feedback to PCORI about their usefulness and suggested improvements.&nbsp; Similarly, societies and advocates could seek out opportunities to review reports conducted outside of PCORI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should support complete transparency in CER.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Physicians and patients deserve to have confidence that the methods and conclusions of CER analyses are objective and unbiased.&nbsp; Societies and patient advocates should call for information about research methods, investigators’ affiliations, and funding sources to be detailed explicitly and disseminated with the findings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access/Dissemination</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies should incorporate CER findings as quickly as possible into practice guidelines, patient guides, and other educational and communication tools</strong>.&nbsp; To maximize the usefulness of CER studies for clinicians and patients, specialty societies should respond quickly to new research, disseminating findings through their journals, continuing medical education (CME) offerings, and educational programs that meet the standards of specialty certifying boards for inclusion in maintenance of certification.&nbsp; Patient advocates should also disseminate evidence-based research findings through their communication channels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should advocate for decision support tools that incorporate guidelines reflecting CER findings</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Physicians can practice more efficiently and effectively when relevant research findings are embedded in decision aids or clinical practice guidelines that are transmitted directly to electronic records.&nbsp; Societies and patient advocates should work with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the HIT vendor and policy communities to ensure that systems and templates for electronic health records can accommodate the incorporation of guidelines reflecting CER findings, and can capture and deliver the data and information that are needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physician-Patient Communication</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies should educate their members about how to talk to their patients about evidence-based medicine, emphasizing the importance of fully disclosing risks and benefits discovered in the research, and describing all viable treatment options.&nbsp; Physician communication should also elicit patients’ concerns, preferences, and values. &nbsp;Patient advocates should educate their constituents about the importance and validity of CER, describing how it can help advance more personalized care</strong>. &nbsp;Doctors are uniquely positioned to persuade patients, most of whom have little experience as consumers or users of research or statistical evidence, of the value and integrity of CER findings.&nbsp; However, many physicians could benefit from advice about how to talk about CER findings and their relevance to patients.&nbsp; Specialty societies are well-suited to provide that assistance, and they should work collaboratively with patient advocates to develop communications strategies to reinforce the benefits of CER in improving care and address concerns that CER will lead to the denial of needed care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should promote shared decision-making, including the use of decision aids that incorporate CER findings</strong>.&nbsp; CER analyses can promote shared decision-making among patients and clinicians.&nbsp; Societies and patient advocates can help promote the use of existing decision aids and&nbsp; encourage the development of new ones.&nbsp; Societies can also encourage physicians to welcome dialogue and empower their patients to become genuine partners in their care by encouraging discussion and questions about their care.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should encourage measure developers to develop measures that are based on proven evidence</strong>.&nbsp; As producers of guidelines that underlie measures, and as consumers of measures, specialty societies can enhance their quality both through basing guidelines on CER analyses and by urging the prompt development and updating of measures as the research base matures.&nbsp; Patient advocates can promote patient experience measures and public reporting derived from measures reflecting evidence-based clinical guidelines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As specialty societies build and expand registries, they should link CER and other evidence bases in order to optimally answer clinical questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Specialty societies are increasingly employing registries to identify and close gaps in quality of care, reduce wasteful and inefficient care variations, and implement quality improvement measures.&nbsp; These registries’ power to shape care will be enhanced if they collect the categories of data that would be most useful to CER researchers.&nbsp; Specialty societies and patient advocates should seek to support these linkages through future specifications for physician quality reporting system (PQRS) registries, meaningful use criteria, and electronic health record (EHR) certification standards.</p>

<p><strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting CER</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Specialty societies and patient advocates should encourage their constituents to communicate the benefits of CER within the medical and patient communities and among the public</strong>.&nbsp; The practice of medicine and the health of the American people will be improved if CER can deliver on its promise, and physicians and engaged patients can be CER’s most effective ambassadors.&nbsp; Physicians and patient leaders can publicly embrace CER and explain how it can improve health care quality and advance personalized care.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>House Democrats unveiled&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR1425-RCP116-56.pdf"">H.R. 1425</a>&nbsp;which would expand and protect key elements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Key provisions of H.R. 1425 include expanding subsidies and eligibility requirements for state-level exchanges. Importantly, states would have the ability to expand premium tax credits beyond 400% of the federal poverty line.&nbsp; H.R. 1425 also fixes the ACA family glitch, where families received premium subsidies based on the affordability of an individual’s employer-sponsored plan, regardless of if the plan was affordable for the entire family. In 2018, The Commonwealth Fund&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/sep/what-do-americans-think-health-coverage-2020-election"">found</a>&nbsp;that 13.8% of U.S. working-age adults were uninsured, and even more were left underinsured. H.R. 1425’s provisions would expand access to affordable health insurance, while simultaneously reducing the prevalence of short-term limited duration plans, which are often harmful. Below is a summary of key policy provisions that relate to NCHC’s policy priorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Title I—Lowering health care costs and protecting people with pre-existing conditions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 101. Improving affordability by expanding premium assistance for consumers.&nbsp;</strong>States are able to give premium tax credits beyond 400% of the federal poverty line. The tax credits will be given on a sliding scale. This would expand access to health insurance in the state exchanges while also ensuring the affordability of the insurance provided.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1352. Use of funds.</strong>&nbsp;States would be allowed to use federal dollars to provide reinsurance payments to insurance companies providing individual coverage in the exchanges. &nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 107. Rescinding the short-term limited duration insurance regulation.&nbsp;</strong>The HHS Secretary would no longer be able to implement or enforce the final rule on short-term limited duration insurance policies. These policies would no longer be widely advertised or promoted for purchase.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 109. Requiring marketplace outreach, educational activities, and annual enrollment targets.&nbsp;</strong>States would receive additional funding to advertise and educate the public on market exchanges with the goal of increasing enrollment numbers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 113. Improving awareness of health coverage options.&nbsp;</strong>HHS would be required to publicly advertise COBRA continuation coverage on the Department of Labor website. Each notice would include information on the state exchanges, eligibility requirements for COBRA coverage, and other pertinent information.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 114. Promoting state innovations to expand coverage.&nbsp;</strong>States would receive additional funding and grants to promote greater enrollment in individual and small group markets.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Title II—Encouraging Medicaid expansion and strengthening the Medicaid Program</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 202. Providing 12-months of continuous eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP.&nbsp;</strong>Individuals who qualify for Medicaid and CHIP are eligible for coverage for 12 months after they are deemed eligible</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 204. Reducing the administrative FMAP for nonexpansion states.&nbsp;</strong>States would receive less federal funding for their Medicaid programs if they choose not to expand.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 206. Primary care pay increase.&nbsp;</strong>Reimbursement rates for primary care physicians would increase for certain services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Title III—Lowering prices through fair drug price negotiation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 301. Establishing a fair drug pricing program.&nbsp;</strong>This program, known as the Fair Price Negotiation Program, would negotiate a fair price for specific high-priced, single-source drugs. The Program would carry the administrative burden to negotiate prices with manufacturers, and also publish a list of selected drugs that would be subjected to negotiation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1191. Establishment of a program.&nbsp;</strong>The Program described above would conduct negotiations with manufacturers to determine the average international market price, or AIM price for negotiation-eligible drugs. Drug prices in the following countries would be used for comparison: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and The United Kingdom.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1192. Selection of negotiation-eligible drugs as selected drugs.&nbsp;</strong>During the first year of the initial price applicability year, the HHS Secretary would select a minimum of 25 negotiation-eligible drugs. Then, the Secretary would select 50 drugs in the subsequent year. The Secretary would choose drugs based on the those with the greatest net spending in the United States. Negotiation-eligible drugs include covered Part D drugs, other high-cost drugs, and insulin.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1193. Manufacturer agreements.&nbsp;</strong>The HHS Secretary and the manufacturer would negotiate the price of the drug and then relay the determined maximum fair price eligible individuals, hospitals, and physicians.&nbsp; If a drug does not have an AIM price, then the Secretary will determine the amount based on the weighted average price. The Secretary would determine the price based on research and development costs, market data, production and distribution costs, and comparisons to existing therapeutic alternatives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1195. Publication of maximum fair prices.&nbsp;</strong>The HHS Secretary would publish the maximum price for each drug negotiated under the new Program.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Section 1198. Civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;</strong>Manufacturers would be forced to pay excess taxes if they do not comply with the new Program.</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Senator&nbsp;Patty Murray (D-WA) are working in good faith on a targeted legislative solution. But unless leadership on both sides of the Capitol get behind that effort, taxpayers and consumers will soon pay a heavy price.”</p>

<p>NCHC is a proud supporter of S. 464, the Independence at Home (IAH) Act, bipartisan legislation recently introduced by Senators Markey (D-MA), Portman (R-OH), Bennet (D-CO), and Cornyn (R-TX).  Our organizational allies recently published a <a href=""http://www.iahnow.org/"">website</a> to assist supporters of the legislation in mobilizing their grassroots to ask Senators to co-sponsor the bill.  S. 464 expands to the entire nation the innovative and highly successful Independence at Home (IAH) demonstration project that has been providing home-based primary medical care to nearly 10,000 Medicare elders with severe chronic illness and disability over the last several years.  To use the activation site, click on any CONTACT YOUR SENATORS bar to easily send a message to Senators about the importance of co-sponsoring S. 464. Suggested language is included in the activation portion of the website, but we know that the most effective messages to Capitol Hill are those that you customize with details about your program and how the legislation would help the seniors and families you serve. </p>

<p>Today, Medicare faces the twin challenges of rising health care costs and an aging population.&nbsp; In response to these challenges, traditional Medicare is pursuing programs and demonstrations aimed at coordinating care for nursing home patients and curbing avoidable hospital readmissions. These programs and demonstrations are built on innovative strategies pioneered by Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are there new opportunities to extend cost-saving innovations developed by MA plans across Medicare? Or should policymakers pursue further reductions in reimbursement to MA plans?&nbsp; What would the impact of these competing approaches be on health care costs and beneficiaries’ care?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our presenters at this roundtable, jointly sponsored by the National Coalition on Health Care and the Partnership for the Future of Medicare, will offer their perspectives on these key questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>We hope you can join us on November 13.</strong></p>

1986,"Insulin: the Life Saving Drug that Needs to be Affordable","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enough is enough-it is time for Congress to address rising insulin prices. Congress has failed to take any action to address the rising cost of insulin. However,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2011/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22congressId%3A116+AND+billStatus%3A%5C%22Introduced%5C%22%22%5D%7D"">the Protecting Access to Biosimilars Act of 2019,</a>&nbsp;introduced by Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO) in early April, is a promising first step to address the issue. The Energy &amp; Commerce Committee held a series of hearings about the rising cost of insulin. The<a href=""https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-priced-out-of-a-lifesaving-drug-the-human-impact-of-rising"">&nbsp;first hearing</a>, held on April 2th, focused on how patients, providers, and advocates have been impacted by the rising cost of insulin. The<a href=""https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-priced-out-of-a-lifesaving-drug-getting-answers-on-the-rising"">&nbsp;second hearing</a>, held on April 10th, investigated PBMs’ and drug manufacturers’ contributions to price increases. As a juvenile diabetic, I sympathized with my fellow juvenile diabetics that testified on April 2nd, and I believe that Congress must make meaningful change to address this issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hearing on April 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;hosted<a href=""https://www.patientsforaffordabledrugs.org/story/gaile-devore/"">&nbsp;Gail DeVore</a>, an advocate and diabetic from Colorado,<a href=""http://www.diabetes.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/william-t-cefalu-md-1.html"">&nbsp;Dr. William T. Cefalu</a>&nbsp;of the American Diabetes Association,<a href=""https://www.endocrine.org/profiles/powers-alvin"">&nbsp;Dr. Alvin C. Powers</a>&nbsp;of the Endocrine, Society,<a href=""https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/people/kasia_lipska.profile"">&nbsp;Dr. Kasia Lipska</a>&nbsp;of Yale School of Medicine,<a href=""http://diabetespac.org/about/board-directors-staff/"">&nbsp;Christel M. Aprigliano</a>&nbsp;of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, and<a href=""https://www.jdrf.org/blog/2019/04/09/jdrf-names-aaron-kowalski-new-president-and-ceo/"">&nbsp;Dr. Aaron Kowalski</a>&nbsp;of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms. DeVore has been a juvenile diabetic for 47 years. She shared personal stories about how the cost of insulin has hindered her quality of life. Ms. DeVore said that she is an advocate and problem solver, but there is “no solution” to being able to afford insulin. As a comfortably middle-class woman with good health insurance, Ms. DeVore maintained that insulin is still extremely unaffordable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Cefalu stated that pharmaceutical industry claims that the rising cost of insulin, among other drugs, can be attributed to research and development expenses. Yet, the chemical composition of insulin has not changed and prices continue to soar. Dr. Cefalu identified policy solutions to address the issue, such as promoting transparency in pricing. Further, Dr. Cefalu said that groundbreaking innovation is useless without affordable and accessible insulin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Lipska noted that the internal supply chain between PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurers is failing. Dr. Lipska called upon drug manufacturers to reduce the cost of insulin, because they have a “moral obligation” to address the rising cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Kowalski outlined three differing goals that Congress needs to address to lower the price of insulin and improve the health of juvenile diabetics across the nation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebates must be eliminated from the drug reimbursement system</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid the uninsured population in getting insulin</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invest in research to find a cure</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, congressional leaders empathized with the advocates and diabetics that spoke at the hearing. Chairman Pallone<a href=""https://nchc.org/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Memo%20for%2020190402%20Insulin%20Hearing%20FINALv2.pdf"">&nbsp;addressed</a>&nbsp;the Hearing beforehand and noted that the prices of insulin have tripled between 2002 and 2013. Further, even those with employer-based insurance could not afford their medication: “People with diabetes with employer-sponsored insurance saw the average price for a 40-day supply of insulin rise from $344 to $666 [between 2012 and 2016].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the private sector, Walmart sells a cheaper, human insulin called&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thediabetescouncil.com/relion-insulin-everything-need-know/"">ReliOn</a>. This version of insulin costs about $25 per vial, and is an affordable solution for those that fall in the insurance coverage gap. However, this solution is not permanent or sustainable. Walmart is currently contracted with Novo Nordisk to provide this cheaper version of insulin. This contract can dissipate at any time. Although this is an effective, short-term option, federal action must address the issue for a more longstanding resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a previous&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/policy-solutions-to-address-the-rising-cost-of-insulin/"">blog post</a>, NCHC proposed policy solutions to address the rising cost of insulin. Yet, without immediate Congressional intervention, in conjunction with private sector intervention, prices for insulin, and other life-saving biologics, will continue to rise.</p>

1994,"Investing in Prevention and Public Health","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to curb the cost of treating disease is to keep people from getting sick in the first place.&nbsp;Yet, increased rates of obesity have contributed to an increased burden of costly diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer throughout the entire health system. At the same time, the enormous progress since the 1960s in reducing tobacco use has plateaued, leaving the United States with 42.1 million adult smokers and a 15.7% smoking rate among high school students – a trend that is increasingly driven by highly marketed alternatives to cigarettes such as small cigars. Obesity- and tobacco-related illnesses impose $190 billion and $170 billion respectively on our already strapped health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is that these costs and those attributable to a range of other health challenges are largely preventable. NCHC supports the following steps to promote evidence-based prevention:</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Congress and the Trump Administration consider policies to address rising prescription drug prices, the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC) hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on March 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to put one promising option on the table: the use of binding arbitration in Medicare Part D to determine prices for a limited set of drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Binding arbitration is a formal process for a buyer and a seller to resolve a price dispute by making their respective cases to an impartial arbitrator. The arbitrator decides a price within the range of the two prices proposed. &nbsp;“Final offer” arbitration requires the arbiter to select one of the two parties’ final offers as the price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://nchc.org/events/congressional-briefing-on-binding-arbitration/"">Leading health policy experts and economists</a>&nbsp;provided an overview of trends in rising pharmaceutical prices and spending, followed by discussion of how binding arbitration could be applied to determine fair pricing for prescription drugs. The panel also described Germany’s approach to assessing and pricing pharmaceuticals, which has a role for arbitration. Finally, experts identified considerations for policymakers in structuring arbitration, as well as broader opportunities for reform in Medicare Part D.</p>

<p><a href=""https://chhs.gmu.edu/profile/view/10332""><strong>Len Nichols</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</strong><a href=""https://nchc.org/2-l-nichols-negotiation-and-arbitration-1/""><strong>Why We Need to Consider Binding Arbitration</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Len Nichols laid out the balancing act sought between two objectives: promoting affordability and encouraging innovation. He credited the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm613498.htm"">Hatch-Waxman Act</a>&nbsp;of 1984 with promoting both innovation and competition in small molecule drugs. By extending exclusivity periods for five years while simultaneously creating a streamlined path for generics, the Act has resulted in approximately 90% of all prescriptions filled by generic drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Hatch-Waxman does not apply to biologic drugs, and biologics are some of the biggest drivers of prescription drug spending. Patients and payers, especially Medicare, are bearing the costs with limited tools for controlling them. Dr. Nichols observed that the “non-interference clause” in the Medicare Part D law, which restricts the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ authority to engage in direct negotiations with manufacturers for Part D covered drugs, amounts to “unilateral disarmament.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Nichols sought to dispel the notion that negotiation equates to price control. To illustrate, he compared the pharmaceutical industry and defense procurement, commenting that the U.S. military has an acceptable process of fixed price contracts. When buying nuclear submarines, the U.S. Navy and its supplier enter fixed price contracts with upside and downside risk. Congress seeks to purchase at a price that protects both taxpayers and national security. Similarly, Congress seeks to lower drug prices for taxpayers and patients while promoting medical innovation.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/faculty/core/richard-g-frank-phd""><strong>Richard Frank</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</strong><a href=""https://nchc.org/3-r-frank-issues-in-drug-price-negotiation-using-binding-arbitration-3/""><strong>How We Might Adapt Arbitration to Pricing Certain Pharmaceuticals</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Richard Frank contrasted the jump in the costs of branded drugs in Part D, which have increased 269% from 2006-2015. A sharp decline in prices of generics has occurred over the same period. Medicare’s actuary projects an annual 4.6% increase in Part D spending through 2027.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Frank identified two factors driving Part D spending on branded drugs:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The design of Part D’s reinsurance component</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reinsurance compensate plans for expensive claims above a threshold amount. The costs of the Medicare Part D reinsurance benefit are allocated among stakeholders, with beneficiaries responsible for 5%, Part D plans liable for 15%, and the federal government and taxpayers picking up the largest share of 80%. This imbalance in risk sharing between Part D plans and the Medicare program gives plans little incentive to hold per beneficiary spending below the catastrophic amount of $5,000. As a result, reinsurance has risen from 25% to 56% of total Part D spending between 2007 and 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":29832} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reinsurance.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-29832""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. The role of unique drugs with strong exclusivity protections</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare Part D drug spending is concentrated among a small list of branded drugs, suggesting that Part D plans have little bargaining power to restrain prices for these drugs. Even if Congress reformed Part D to put private plans at risk for more of Part D spending, experience suggests plans lack the tools to bargain better prices for the so-called “blockbusters” with no real therapeutic substitutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Dr. Frank, in circumstances where extreme pricing power exists, such as the launch of new therapies protected with market exclusivity, binding arbitration is preferable to administrative price setting as a method for limiting prices. Countervailing buying power is needed to balance the power of sole suppliers. Medicare has such size as a buyer, and could be given authority by Congress to use its power in a limited set of circumstances. Importantly, policymakers need to strictly define the criteria for which drugs would be subject to a negotiation, the period of negotiation, and how the arbitration procedure would be carried out to promote administrative simplicity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking beyond health care, binding arbitration is used to resolve a range of economic disputes or determine a fair price or settlement in certain circumstances. The well-known examples are wage settlement cases when negotiations have reached impasse.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.aarp.org/ppi/info-2014/leigh-purvis.html""><strong>Leigh Purvis</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</strong><a href=""https://nchc.org/4-purvis-germanys-approach-2/""><strong>How Germany Uses Binding Arbitration to Set Pharmaceutical Prices</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2010 German law,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/english/statutory_health_insurance/amnog_evaluation_of_new_pharmaceutical/amnog_english.jsp"">Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act (AMNOG)</a>, mandates the use of binding arbitration to set prices for certain classes of drugs when negotiations fail. Germany uses a payment system with multiple private payers governed by a non-governmental “Federal Joint Committee” that sets rules and coverage policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AMNOG established a process for assessing the value of new drugs using comparative effectiveness research conducted by a non-governmental institute. New drugs can enter the market once deemed safe and effective, and manufacturers can set a price and sell the drug for twelve months. During the twelve months, the institute evaluates and rates the clinical effectiveness of the new drug, comparing it to existing therapies when substitutes exist. &nbsp;The drug maker then begins negotiating with the Federal Joint Committee to determine a price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In rare instances when the Federal Joint Committee and the drug maker cannot agree on a price, the arbitration process may be invoked. Disputes are brought to a five member board, which includes one representative of the drug maker and insurers. The Chairman casts a deciding vote in the event of a tie. The decision is binding, although it can be challenged by either party and revisited with new evidence after one year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The German AMNOG process appears to be working without stifling access, with more than 300 drugs assessed over approximately seven years and less than 30 drugs being withdrawn from the market from May 2018 to March 2019.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Antos criticized arbitration to set drug prices and questioned what underlying data and assumptions would be used by Medicare to justify its offer price in negotiation. He asserted that competition works in pharmaceutical markets, citing the falling prices among competitive therapies for Hepatitis C. Dr. Antos called for structural reforms that re-balance incentives for innovation and competition, and recommended Congress repair the flawed Part D reinsurance program to give plans more incentive to negotiate more aggressively for high-priced drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Binding arbitration can be an effective counterbalance to drug manufacturer’s extreme price setting power (e.g. where Part D plans have little to no bargaining power for high-cost drugs with few substitutes). However, it should be accompanied by other reforms that promote value and encourage competition in the pharmaceutical market.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>“Final offer” binding arbitration requires the arbitrator to select one of the two party’s final offers. This encourages parties to bargain in good faith and reach a settlement, rather than take their dispute to binding arbitration.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Germany has created an evidence-based process for establishing prices and rewarding innovative drugs based on genuine clinical benefits. Arbitration is used as a last resort when an agreement on price cannot be reached through negotiations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>In structuring binding arbitration, policymakers would need to specify a number of factors, the type of drugs included, the criteria used by an arbitrator in evaluating price, and the time period for negotiation. Congress would also need to amend the “non-interference clause” in the Medicare Modernization Act to clear a pathway for arbitration over Medicare Part D drugs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Panelists agreed that Congress should prioritize reform of the Part D reinsurance program while examining other reforms in benefit design, such as formularies and cost-sharing. There was also consensus that comparative effectiveness research has an important role to play to inform market participants.</li>

<p>By John Rother</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As seen&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-obamacare-working/progress-but-obstacles-remain"">posted online</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;U.S. News &amp;&nbsp;World Report</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Affordable Care Act was enacted nearly five years ago with the goal of addressing multiple dysfunctions in U.S. health insurance and health care delivery. Among the law’s aspirations was to make it possible for individuals with preexisting conditions to buy insurance coverage while simultaneously slowing the out-of-control growth in the costs of care. After less than a year in operation, and with several key provisions still not in effect, it’s clearly too early for any final evaluation. There are positive indications that progress is being made toward those aspirations, but major challenges lie ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Millions of Americans have been able to obtain coverage who were previously uninsured, and competition among insurers seems to be robust in many, though not all, state marketplaces. Medicare’s drug benefit and coverage for preventative services has been substantially improved. New forms of health delivery, such as Accountable Care Organizations, promise to better coordinate care for those who have complex medical needs and generate the greatest costs. And driven in part by the signal the law’s cost-containment provisions sent to the health system, overall health care spending growth has substantially moderated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet serious obstacles remain to health care access and affordability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most notably, roughly half of the states have so far chosen not to implement the Medicaid expansion. While state officials can debate the wisdom of the choice, it has created a “no coverage zone” afflicting vulnerable individuals and families with incomes too low for subsidized private coverage and too high for traditional Medicaid. By delaying access to necessary care and increasing the amount of unreimbursed care provided by doctors and hospitals, this coverage gap has the potential to increase costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as serious is the possibility that new cost-control initiatives might be weakened by the new Congress. Attacks on Medicare’s ability to test new payment and delivery models are particularly short-sighted in this regard, and could signal to the medical industry that cost restraint is no longer a priority. In addition, lifting mandate requirements for individuals and employers could compromise the ability of the insurance system to spread risk and keep premiums affordable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, failure to move forward in other areas of health policy could be damaging as well. If policymakers give up on efforts to permanently reform physician payment or otherwise slow the transition away from volume-based reimbursement, growth in health care costs could accelerate once more. And if pharmaceutical companies or other parts of the medical industrial economy fail to restrain prices for new drugs or devices, the very therapies we hope will improve outcomes will end up being out of reach for many Americans due to their exorbitant costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can we do better than current law? We must. We must do more to deliver better care at a lower cost. We must find ways to make coverage more widespread and more affordable throughout the country. To be sure, there is much to be done to improve the U.S. health care system. But if we’re not careful, we could undermine those indications of progress that we’ve just started to see.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Senators Thune and Carper and Representatives Black and Blumenauer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On behalf of the Smarter Health Care Coalition (Coalition) and the undersigned organizations, we are writing to applaud the Chronic Disease Management Act of 2018. This critical legislation will help patients with chronic conditions access high-value health care services and medications that ensure optimal health and well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coalition represents a broad-based and diverse group of health care innovators, including health plans, consumer groups, provider-related organizations, employer groups, trade associations, academia centers and professors, foundations, and life science companies. Our goal is to leverage our combined perspectives and experiences to achieve smarter health care that improves the patient experience through better benefit design and the alignment of coverage, quality, and value-based payment goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, approximately half of all Americans have at least one chronic condition and about a quarter suffer from two or more. Each year, millions of Americans struggle to receive the appropriate care due to onerous cost burdens. Studies show that chronic conditions account for $.86 of every dollar spent on health care and, without appropriate management, lead to adverse effects on health outcomes and quality of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This problem can be exacerbated for employees and individuals enrolled in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), a rapidly growing segment of the insurance marketplace. Studies show that the percentage of employers offering HDHPs grew by 20 percent between 2005 and 2017, and that the percentage of employees covered by HDHPs over the same period grew by 24 percent.1 Plans coupling HDHPs with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are currently prohibited from offering services and medications to manage chronic conditions on a pre-deductible basis, creating cost barriers to care for chronically ill patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Chronic Disease Management Act of 2018 addresses this problem by allowing HSA-HDHPs to provide plan members access to health care services and medications that manage chronic conditions on a pre-deductible basis, consistent with the principles of value-based insurance design. Doing so will yield an enormous benefit to patients, employers, and payers alike, including improved health, enhanced workplace&nbsp;productivity, and the avoidance of unnecessary emergency care visits and hospitalizations to the benefit of patients and will ensure a more rational and sustainable health care system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, thank you for your leadership in authoring this important legislation and we look forward to working with you toward its passage. Please contact Coalition Co-Directors, Andrew MacPherson at&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:andrew@healthsperien.com"">andrew@healthsperien.com</a>, Ray Quintero at&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:rquintero@healthsperien.com"">rquintero@healthsperien.com</a>, and Katy Spangler at&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:katy@spanglerstrategies.com"">katy@spanglerstrategies.com</a>&nbsp;with any questions.</p>

2022,"Joint letter applauding the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act","<!-- wp:heading {""level"":6} -->
<h6><em>This letter was originally organized and sent by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores to Senators Michael Bennet and Dean Heller. To see the&nbsp;citations and full list of co-signers, please click&nbsp;<a href=""https://nchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EPCS-Act-Letter-of-Support_Senate-_Feb-27-2018.pdf"">here</a>.</em></h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Senators,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We write to thank you for your leadership on the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act and urge your colleagues in Congress to support this vital legislation. The opioid crisis is devastating families and communities from coast to coast. In 2016, more than 42,000 people died as a result of the crisis, more than any year on record according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of approaches have been summoned to attack this epidemic, but we believe that the use of already-existing electronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS) technology is going underutilized. EPCS reduces opportunities for diversion, as the DEA-approved electronic prescribing process provides more protection from diversion than the current system of paper and oral prescriptions. EPCS prescriptions cannot be altered, cannot be copied, and are electronically trackable. Furthermore, the federal DEA rules for EPCS establish strict security measures, such as two-factor authentication, that reduce the likelihood of fraudulent prescribing. Additionally, electronic prescribing offers new dimensions of safety and security for controlled substance prescriptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past few years, the private sector has dramatically improved its use of E-Prescribing. Data from self-reported drug abusers suggest that between 3 percent and 9 percent of diverted opioid prescriptions are tied to forged prescriptions.2 While in 2013, 1 billion prescriptions were e-prescribed, in 2016, 1.6 billion prescriptions were e-prescribed. Yet, despite this vast growth, EPCS is lagging behind broader eprescribing trends. According to health information network Surescripts, while approximately 90 percent of non-controlled substance prescriptions are e-prescribed, only 15 percent of prescriptions for controlled substances were submitted electronically in 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act promotes the use of EPCS to help address the opioid crisis by requiring that controlled substances for Medicare beneficiaries are prescribed electronically. This connection will encourage wider adoption of EPCS and help curtail “doctor shopping.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, has indicated that a national e-prescribing system would allow his agency to think more strategically about controlled substances and their REMS program. EPCS could be used to strengthen the tools at the disposal of prescribers and pharmacists and even present a solution to a problem recognized by the Commissioner, interoperability across state lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven states (New York, Maine, Virginia, Connecticut, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Arizona) have already passed legislation to mandate EPCS. These states now have a significantly more secure process in place or in the works. The system provides security and convenience from start to finish: from the doctors’ electronic prescription-writing process to the pharmacy dispensing medications to the patient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A national bill such as the one you have proposed would make available the promise of EPCS to the entire country and mark a significant step forward in the fight against the opioid crisis. Your bill would help fill a critical gap in the current prescription drug distribution chain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time to act on this common-sense policy is now. EPCS is a bi-partisan solution that the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Epidemic endorsed as a part of its November 2017 recommendations. In the same 2017 report the Commission states that each day 175 deaths are attributed to the opioid epidemic. We can no longer afford to delay the advancement of policies, such as electronic prescribing, that will help curb diversion and abuse rates and inform appropriate interventions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your critical leadership with the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act. We encourage your colleagues to cosponsor the bill and ensure its speedy passage in both chambers of Congress.</p>

2060,"It’s time for Congress to shift focus from cost-shifting to cost-saving","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congress should give up the latest attempt to revive fundamentally flawed ACA repeal legislation. It is time to refocus on ways to actually slow the growth of health costs rather than simply shifting them to patients and states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be sure, a fresh start must begin with immediate steps to preserve health coverage—by funding cost-sharing reductions and extending the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But it should not end there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below, we map out five policy directions that actually address our fundamental health care challenge: the growing unaffordability of health care goods and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Support State-Led Health Reform</strong><br>Governors of all political stripes have called for more rational approaches to state waiver requests under ACA’s Section 1332 and Medicaid’s Section 1115. Without the specter of deep cuts in federal funding, substantial policy progress should be possible here. As long as basic guardrails ensuring public input and protecting coverage, benefits, and affordability remain in place, federal policymakers should aggressively support state initiatives that extend coverage, reform delivery and payment across payer types, and shift long-term care services away from institutional settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Free Up Medicare Providers and Plans to Battle Chronic Disease</strong><br>The best Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and the best providers (in the Next Gen ACO program and elsewhere) are delivering on the promise of better outcomes at lower costs – by improving care for high-cost, high-need beneficiaries. But restrictions on home-based care, telehealth and remote patient monitoring technologies, and non-medical interventions are holding back success. Building on the Senate Finance Committee’s CHRONIC Care Act and recent House legislation, Congress should quickly send Medicare chronic care legislation to the Administration and then work with them to target other barriers to reform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Invest in Primary Care</strong><br>America devotes about half as much of its health spending to primary care as other nations – and it’s helping drive up our overall costs. Fixing this imbalance will require long-term shifts in how we deliver and pay for care. But in coming weeks, Congress can start by extending expiring funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers, the National Health Service Corps, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Invest in Public Health</strong><br>America needs to recommit to addressing the factors that are driving health costs up. Investments upstream and a focus on the broader determinants of health could reduce the need for medical services in the first place. For example, addressing the causes of&nbsp;costly conditions such as opioid abuse, asthma, hypertension, and heart disease early on could not only reduce overall health costs, but improve our country’s overall health and well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Advance Market-Based Solutions to High Drug Prices</strong><br>The fastest growing category of health care expenditures today is prescription drugs – driven by unsustainable industry pricing practices. Fixing our broken pharmaceutical marketplace demands the same market solutions needed in any functioning market: transparency, competition, and value. The bipartisan CREATES Act, which bars brand name manufacturers from denying samples to potential generic competitors, would be a good start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, these ideas aren’t the only paths to progress. But any serious health reform effort must address cost and affordability. The need is urgent and stakes are high.</p>
